### Predicting (in)action by the UN Security Council by parsing “UNish”

It has been hypothesized that the UN, led by the Security Council, does nothing. In fact, “does the UN… do anything” is among the top predictive search suggestions offered by Google. Active observers publish thousands of articles annually decrying ineffectiveness, bottlenecking, apathy, and political plays on the part of the UN that manifest in a damning lack of regard for populations affected by crises. 

As the UN’s primary decisionmaking body, the Security Council has borne the brunt of this criticism. Security Council resolutions “demanding an end to hostilities” but resulting in little concrete action have become the stuff of biting satire. Some of the Council’s decisions, such as drawing down peacekeepers amidst an unfolding genocide, have surprised even the most forgiving of UN sympathizers.

**Project Question**

Based on the texts of Security Council resolutions passed in the last 30 years, this project seeks to make predictions on two levels:

1. Will the Council act with regards to an issue pertaining to peace and security that is brought before it; and

2. If action is taken, what kind of action will it be? Examples include “soft” measures (deployment of observation missions), “prohibitive” measures (naval blockades, embargoes, sanctions against offending regimes), or “hard” measures (missions authorized to use force to protect civilians in conflict, so-called “Chapter VII missions”).

Separately, I would like to analyze the peculiar “UNish” vernacular of the Council to determine how much of the text of its resolutions is blabber (“expressing grave concern”, “strongly condemning”) and how much is geared toward decisive action (authorizing some form of tangible action or intervention).

**Why I chose this question**

I have spent most of my career working with or in countries with a measurable UN presence. Typically these are countries affected by some form of instability, to which UN missions, which are always authorized by the Security Council, are sent. These missions have achieved results best described as “mixed”. In some cases, the missions are viewed as toothless and worthless; in others, they are thought to bring only harm; in a fraction of cases, they are considered either resounding successes or the only viable presence keeping the population afloat in a state somewhat approximating stability. Where populations depend on UN action to change the status quo, observers often try to analyze the text of UN resolutions to determine what/whether anything will change in the near future. I would like to try to automate this analytical process. 

If successful, the model could also be applied to the analysis of other types of documents with real-world applications, such as legislative decisions, to assist in the development of more actionable and responsible representative bodies. 

**Data**

For the primary portion of the project, I plan to use the text of 1,644 Security Council resolutions from January 1986 through June 2015 available on the [UN website](http://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/). 

The timeframe was chosen on the following bases: 

* Narcissism: I wanted to look at resolutions passed during my lifetime.
* Objective global realities: starting in or around 1986, Soviet domestic policy began thawing, Soviet foreign policy was becoming more pacifist, and the Cold War was coming to an end. Bloc-based voting was becoming less prevalent, and former Warsaw Pact countries were becoming more collaborative in the international arena, limiting the risk of blanket vetoes. At the same time, major conflict tendencies that would define the early 1990s were beginning to take shape in Europe, Central America, and Africa. The aftermath of these conflicts and the international community’s response (or lack thereof) to them affect national and global security realities to this day.
