The President: The Security Council will now

Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the

consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that the
presidency of the Council has met with the
representatives of the parties, who have confirmed that
they maintain their well-known positions vis-à-vis the
item on the Council’s agenda. On the basis of those
meetings, with the consent of the members of the
Council, the presidency has drawn the conclusion that
the Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, China, Congo, France, Ghana,
Indonesia, Italy, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1789 (2007).

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
