Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Timor-Leste
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Mission of Support in East Timor
(S/2003/449)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Timor-Leste in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Guterres
(Timor-Leste) took the seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting with the understanding
reached in the Council’s prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Mission of Support in East Timor (S/2003/449).
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2003/545, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
