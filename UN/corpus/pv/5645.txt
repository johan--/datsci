The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Afghanistan
The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representatives of
Afghanistan, in which he requests to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the Council’s
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative
to participate in the consideration of the item, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Yunus
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the situation in Afghanistan
and its implications for international peace and security
(S/2007/152). Members of the Council also have before
them document S/2007/169, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall now put the draft resolution to
the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, China, Congo, France, Ghana, Indonesia,
Italy, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Russian Federation,
Slovakia, South Africa, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution
1746 (2007).
Mr. Spatafora (Italy): My delegation was honoured
to coordinate the process that has led to the adoption by
consensus of this resolution. I wish to thank all delegations
and, above all, you, Mr. President, and your team, for the
invaluable contributions that we received from each and
every one of them throughout the process.
The vote is all the more rewarding for us since the
Council has adopted this resolution as a presidential text
showing cohesion and unity on a critical issue at a critical
juncture. As our Foreign Minister stated before the Council
three days ago (see S/PV.5641), we were convinced that the
people of Afghanistan and the women and men of the
United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
(UNAMA) needed a strong signal of support.
We believe that this resolution is such a signal. We
are not modifying the mandate of UNAMA, of course, but I
believe that we are doing something even more important
for the Mission. We are offering a new vision, we are
giving a new pulse, we are shaping a new framework for
action.
The text before us is not business as usual. In fact, it
is particularly rich, and it addresses all the priorities for the
next months identified by the Secretary-General in his
report — promotion of the coherence of the international
engagement, outreach, support for regional cooperation,
humanitarian coordination, protection of human rights, and
monitoring of the situation of civilians in armed conflict.
As an overarching priority, the resolution affirms the
crucial importance of the synergies among the different
aspects of the international community’s engagement in
Afghanistan, stressing the need for a comprehensive
approach to address the challenges that Afghanistan faces.
We hope that such a comprehensive approach will be put
into practice in the shortest term and at the highest level
through the unique format offered by the Joint
Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) and under the
leadership of the Afghan Government. This is the only way
to be in a position one year from now to adopt a resolution
with a long list of developments to welcome and no
concerns to express.
The President: There are no further speakers on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
