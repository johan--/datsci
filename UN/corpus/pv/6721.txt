Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Timor-Leste
Report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Integrated Mission in
Timor-Leste (S/2012/43)
The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representatives of Australia,
Brazil, Japan, Malaysia and New Zealand to participate
in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2012/106, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Australia, Brazil, France,
Germany, Guatemala, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Portugal, South Africa, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2012/43, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the United Nations Integrated
Mission in Timor-Leste.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
In favour:
Azerbaijan, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Guatemala, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal,
Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 2037 (2012).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom is pleased to have co-sponsored
resolution 2037 (2012). As we made clear in our
statement to the Council yesterday, we commend the
development of the Joint Transition Plan by the
Government of Timor-Leste and the United Nations
Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) and
believe that it can set a standard for future
peacekeeping to peacebuilding transitions.
We encourage the United Nations and host States
to work together to produce comprehensive, detailed
plans for safeguarding the future stability of a country
supported by the Security Council.
We are confident that the United Nations and the
Government of Timor-Leste will continue the
cooperation they enjoyed in the development of the
Joint Transition Plan to present a clear proposal for the
shape, concept and objectives of the post-UNMIT
United Nations presence.
This is a landmark opportunity for the Security
Council to reshape the United Nations presence in a
way that can support Timorese efforts to sustain the
peace and to tackle Timor-Leste’s longer-term
peacebuilding challenges. We are committed to
ensuring that the views of the Timorese Government
and people are taken into account during this period of
transition.
At the same time, we are clear that nothing in
paragraph 21 of this resolution can be read as limiting
or qualifying the role or decision-making authority of
the Council in determining the mandate and
configuration of United Nations missions.
The President (spoke in French): The Council
has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
