The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Non-proliferation
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Germany and the Islamic Republic
of Iran in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mottaki
(Islamic Republic of Iran) took a seat at the
Council table; Mr. Matussek (Germany) took the
seat reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/170, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Germany and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2007/100, which contains the
note by the President of the Security Council
transmitting the report of the Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): The
State of Qatar believes that Iran has the right to nuclear
energy research and production for peaceful purposes.
That is an inalienable right of Iran under articles I and
II of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons, that no one can deny. We do not doubt Iran‚Äôs
genuine intentions as regards the peaceful purposes of
its nuclear programme.
We are deeply saddened that the Security Council
is being forced to impose new sanctions on the Islamic
Republic of Iran. We do not view sanctions as an
appropriate means of pressure. On the contrary,
sanctions can sometimes complicate matters and, in our
opinion, signal another failure at diplomatic efforts.
Continued pressure does not help to build confidence,
which is already lost between the two parties; rather, it
can sometimes have serious consequences, given the
already volatile situation in that region of the world.
The dead end that has been reached in the negotiations
between the countries concerned and Iran makes it
necessary for us to seek new prospects and to explore
all possible means that could pave the way to a
peaceful solution to this impasse through diplomatic
means.
The State of Qatar is keen to see all States adhere
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons. We believe that to be a bedrock principle
from which we cannot deviate. Even as we voted
against resolution 1696 (2006), we were absolutely
clear that we were not expressing an opinion opposed
to that principle; rather, we wanted to allow Iran more
time to study the offer put to it by the group of six
countries. We look forward to seeing specific proposals
from both parties that can contribute to revitalizing the
prospects for a diplomatic solution.
Addressing non-proliferation issues, which is the
basis for the positive vote to be cast by the State of
Qatar, should not be done selectively. We do not see
the Council dealing with those issues with different
criteria. In our view, the Council is required to follow
the same approach towards countries that do not
comply with their obligations under the NPT, as well as
towards those that do not respect it in the first place.
That is why we introduced a clear and direct proposal
regarding the draft resolution on the establishment in
the Middle East of a zone free of nuclear weapons and
their means of delivery. We regret that the sponsors of
that draft resolution did not take that proposal on
board.
S/PV.5647
307-28152
Mr. Gayama (Congo) (spoke in French): Allow
me to explain the vote that my delegation will cast
shortly in connection with the very sensitive issue of
compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation regime.
Since it began its term on the Council, Congo has
understood that the unity of the Security Council is
essential to give the necessary authority to the
messages it sends to the entire international community
or to individual Member States. It was with that
concern in mind that Congo participated constructively
in the debates that took place prior to this meeting on
this issue. The decision we are about to take is of
particular importance.
Congo believes that this is basically and only
about ensuring compliance with the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It is
important to keep in mind that the NPT is based on
three pillars that must be equally observed. The first is
non-proliferation, which is the subject of this meeting.
The second is nuclear disarmament, which would send
a strong message as to the genuine desire of nuclear
Powers to firmly commit themselves to the path of
confidence-building measures. And the third is the
inalienable right of signatory States to develop and
have access to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
Congo reaffirms its commitment to the full
implementation of the Treaty and the need to respect
the right of every State party ‚Äî including the Islamic
Republic of Iran ‚Äî to use civil nuclear energy and to
develop the capacity to produce it.
However, we understand that the main problem in
this case is the lack of trust in the strictly peaceful
nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. According to
the International Atomic Energy Agency, that
programme has been outside the scope of any controls
for almost 20 years. Congo believes that the solution to
this crisis is to be found through dialogue and
negotiation, without any threats to use force. It is for
that reason that Congo urges the continuation of
negotiations within the existing framework or in
another context.
The vote we will cast shortly should therefore not
be interpreted as an expression of any sort of hostility
or punitive measure. The role of the Security Council
is not to become an instrument of coercion. Through its
vote, Congo would like to signal the steps that Iran
should take, which should include the suspension of its
uranium enrichment programme. That would not be a
sign on weakness, but rather a reassuring gesture
allowing the rebuilding of confidence in order to find a
peaceful and lasting solution. Congo therefore urges
Iran ‚Äî a country with which we have normal
relations ‚Äî to heed our call and to opt for dialogue and
cooperation.
Mr. Jenie (Indonesia): Indonesia is of the view
that the purpose of the draft resolution is not to punish
the Government or people of Iran, but to be a vehicle
for persuading the Iranian Government to comply with
previous resolutions of the Council and resolve
outstanding issues with the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA). It must therefore be clear that
the draft resolution is not a final, irrevocable position,
but a reversible one.
The draft resolution provides for suspension of
the implementation measure consequent upon two
related conditions. Those involve Iran taking action to
suspend its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities,
that action to be verified by the IAEA, a compliance
that would then set the stage for negotiations that
should be in good faith and aimed at reaching an early
and mutually acceptable outcome. We understand that
the parties are in total agreement to that approach. It is
also of great significance that the measures specified in
Security Council resolution 1737 (2006) would also be
terminated following the determination that Iran has
complied with its obligations.
Should Iran feel it to be necessary to move ahead
towards a negotiated solution, the draft resolution
provides that opportunity in accordance with the
proposals made in June 2006, which are still on the
table and serve as the basis for operative paragraph 10
of the draft resolution. We therefore enjoin the
Government of Iran to keep that door open, because
through it lies a comprehensive negotiated agreement
based on mutual respect and international confidence
in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran‚Äôs nuclear
programme.
The delegation of Indonesia notes that the draft
resolution has accommodated some of the concerns of
my Government and that several of our amendments
were taken on board. Those include the reference to a
Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction that
firmly notes that we are concerned about the problem
of non-proliferation in general and in the region in
particular. We believe that the establishment of zones
free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction
S/PV.5647
07-281524
is a critical measure towards strengthening global
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The
establishment of such zones, including in the Middle
East, will contribute to strengthening regional and
global peace and security.
One paragraph concerns the need for all State
parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to comply fully with all of
their obligations under the Treaty. Our understanding
of the paragraph is that the three pillars of the NPT
should be pursued in a balanced and non-discriminatory
manner. We have consistently expressed our view that
not only should we emphasize the non-proliferation
obligations of non-nuclear-weapon States, but we must
also require nuclear-weapon States to comply fully
with their nuclear disarmament obligations under
article VI of the Treaty. The article expressly states that
‚ÄúEach of the Parties to the Treaty
undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on
effective measures relating to cessation of the
nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear
disarmament, and on a treaty on general and
complete disarmament under strict and effective
international control.‚Äù
It is our conviction that in the end, the only
guarantee for eliminating the fear caused by the
possible use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is their
total elimination. All concerned parties are called upon,
in the interest of an early and mutually acceptable
diplomatic outcome, to negotiate in good faith.
Finally, I wish to stress that the solution to the
issue of Iran should in no way affect or change the
inalienable rights of all parties to the NPT, including
Iran, to develop and research the production and use of
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, without
discrimination, in accordance with the Treaty. That
remains an inalienable right of all State parties to the
Treaty that should always be respected.
With that understanding, my delegation will vote
in favour of the resolution.
The President: I should like to make a statement
in explanation of vote in my national capacity, as the
representative of South Africa.
South Africa will vote in favour of the resolution
before the Council today. Although far from ideal, it is
a consequence of concern about the need to build
international confidence in Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme.
South Africa approached the resolution on its
merits and with the perspective of a country that is not
party to any dispute or conflict. The Council is well
aware that South Africa is fully committed to the
elimination of all weapons of mass destruction and is
therefore a strong advocate against both the horizontal
and vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Inevitably, we are against the development of nuclear
weapons by Iran, or any other country, for that matter.
Our position is informed by our own national
experience as the only country, to have voluntarily
dismantled its nuclear weapons and related
programmes.
In that regard, South Africa acts on the basis of
principle and in full support of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), where
we are an active member of the Board of Governors.
We work consistently to promote consensus within the
IAEA.
While South Africa recognizes that the Security
Council may be called upon to impose coercive
measures such as sanctions, we believe those measures
should be utilized with great caution and only to
support the resumption of political dialogue and
negotiations to achieve a peaceful solution. South
Africa‚Äôs interventions in the Council have therefore
focused on trying to de-escalate tensions, promote
dialogue to establish confidence in the nuclear
programme of Iran and ensure that the IAEA inspectors
remain on the ground in Iran and that Iran remains part
of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
South Africa has always been very clear, as a
matter of principle, that the Security Council must
remain within its mandate of addressing threats to
international peace and security. If the sponsors of the
resolution were convinced that the Iranian programme
was a threat to international peace, then the Security
Council should have been asked to take a decision on a
draft that would have concentrated on that, and not to
act as if the Iranian Government itself posed a threat to
international peace and security.
South Africa proposed a number of constructive
amendments to the draft resolution. Our purpose was to
assist the Security Council to find language for a new
resolution that matched the stated objectives of the
sponsors that the resolution would be ‚Äúproportionate,
incremental and reversible‚Äù.
S/PV.5647
507-28152
We remain deeply disappointed that not all our
proposals were accommodated. The resolution does,
however, correctly acknowledge that there is a need to
respect the right of all countries, including Iran, to
exploit the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, subject
to appropriate safeguards. We are particularly pleased
with the fact that the resolution now reaffirms the need
of all States parties to the NPT to comply fully with all
their obligations, which corresponds to our view that
the twin obligations of nuclear disarmament and
nuclear non-proliferation require our equal attention.
After all, there is no basis for arguing that weapons of
mass destruction are safe in some hands and not in
others.
We note that the IAEA has been able to verify the
non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran.
However, we share the concern of the IAEA Director
General that the Agency continues to be unable ‚Äúto
reconstruct fully the history of Iran‚Äôs nuclear
programme and some of its components‚Äù because the
necessary level of transparency and cooperation have
not been provided by Iran.
Like other members of the Council, South Africa
sought to engage in the negotiation process in its
national capacity, mindful of the duty bestowed on all
Council members to contribute towards a peaceful and
negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear stand-off,
which is an issue that affects the entire international
community ‚Äî indeed, humanity as a whole.
The 15 members of the Security Council will take
a difficult decision, and after today‚Äôs vote a great deal
of work still lies ahead if the international community
hopes to prevent heightened tensions from spiralling
out of control, to the detriment of all. A path needs to
be urgently found back to negotiations, restraint and
compromise on all sides. South Africa therefore hopes
that the latest offer by Iran to resume negotiations will
lead to concrete results.
South Africa urges Iran to provide the necessary
assistance and cooperation to the Agency in its efforts
to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible,
since that will make a substantial contribution to
building confidence in Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme. It is
imperative that confidence be established in Iran‚Äôs
nuclear programme for peaceful purposes.
Every effort must be made to resume dialogue
and enter into meaningful negotiations to find a
sustainable long-term solution to this matter, since no
one will win through a process of confrontation that
could lead to disastrous consequences in a highly
volatile region.
We hope, therefore, that support for this draft
resolution will not be perceived as an obstacle to future
negotiations. It is in that spirit that we will vote in
favour of the draft resolution.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, China, Congo, France, Ghana,
Indonesia, Italy, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1747 (2007).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): I
would like to begin by reading out the text of a
statement that has been agreed by the Foreign
Ministers of China, France, Germany, Russia, the
United Kingdom and the United States of America,
with the support of the High Representative of the
European Union. The statement reads as follows:
‚ÄúThe unanimous adoption of Security
Council resolution 1747 (2007) reflects the
international community‚Äôs profound concerns
over Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme. We deplore Iran‚Äôs
failure to comply with the earlier resolutions of
the Security Council and the International Atomic
Energy Agency, and we call upon Iran once again
to comply fully with all its international
obligations.
‚ÄúWe are committed to seeking a negotiated
solution that would address the international
community‚Äôs concerns. The purpose of
negotiations would be to reach a comprehensive
agreement with Iran, based on mutual respect,
that would re-establish international confidence
in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran‚Äôs
nuclear programme and would open the way to
S/PV.5647
07-281526
improving relations and developing wider
cooperation between Iran and all our countries.
‚ÄúWe recognize Iran‚Äôs rights under the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT) to develop research, production and use of
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in
conformity with its NPT obligations. In that
respect, future arrangements, modalities and
timing will be dealt with in negotiations.
‚ÄúFull transparency and cooperation by Iran
with the International Atomic Energy Agency is
essential in order to address outstanding
concerns. We reiterate our full support for the
Agency and its staff.
‚ÄúWe stand by our suspension-for-suspension
proposal. That means that for the duration of
negotiations ‚Äî which would take place within an
agreed time frame, extendable by mutual
agreement ‚Äî Iran would maintain an Agency-
verified suspension, as required by Security
Council resolution 1737 (2006) and, now,
resolution 1747 (2007). Security Council
discussion of Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme would
also be suspended, as would the implementation
of the measures adopted under the relevant
Council resolutions.
‚ÄúWe reconfirm that the proposals we
presented to Iran in June 2006 stay on the table.
They include cooperation with Iran on civil
nuclear energy, legally binding guarantees on the
supply of nuclear fuel and wider political,
security and economic cooperation. Those
proposals remain on the table.
‚ÄúWe urge Iran to take this opportunity to
engage with us all to find a negotiated way
forward. Our proposals would bring far-reaching
benefits to Iran and to the region, and they
provide a means to address the international
community‚Äôs concerns while taking account of
Iran‚Äôs legitimate interests.
‚ÄúIn a region that has known too much
instability and violence, let us find an agreed way
forward that builds confidence and promotes
peace and mutual respect. In that spirit, we
propose further talks with the Islamic Republic of
Iran to see if a mutually acceptable way can be
found to open negotiations.‚Äù
That concludes the statement on behalf of the six
Foreign Ministers. I should like now to make some
remarks in my national capacity.
It is just short of a year since the Security
Council first took action on the Iranian nuclear issue,
following the referral of the issue to the Council by the
International Atomic Energy Agency. Our concern
throughout has been twofold: to promote prospects for
a negotiated solution, on which suspension of
enrichment by Iran depends; and, secondly, to reinforce
the role of the Agency, as our resolution today again
does.
Those concerns led to the elaboration of a
detailed offer of long-term cooperation from the six
nations whose Ministers‚Äô statement I have just read.
But those Ministers also agreed to seek further Security
Council action on Iran should our demands not be met.
Iran‚Äôs continuing defiance prompted the adoption
of resolution 1696 (2006) in July 2006, setting the
framework for the Council‚Äôs actions, including a
binding Chapter VII decision that Iran should suspend
its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities.
Despite that, Iran ignored the Council.
That led in turn to further Council action. On
23 December, the Security Council adopted ‚Äî as
today, by unanimity ‚Äî resolution 1737 (2006),
reaffirming the mandatory requirement that Iran
suspend its enrichment-related and reprocessing
activities, and clarifying that Iran must also suspend
construction of the heavy-water research reactor at
Arak. It also introduced a number of measures aimed at
restricting Iran‚Äôs development of sensitive nuclear
technologies and its development of ballistic missiles
that could deliver them.
Those measures were an incremental and
proportionate response to Iran‚Äôs continued failure to
comply with the requirements of resolution 1696
(2006), aimed at persuading Iran that its interests were
best served by putting in place the conditions necessary
for discussions to seek a negotiated resolution of the
issue.
As requested in resolution 1737 (2006), the
Director General of the Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei,
reported on 22 February that Iran had continued to
pursue these sensitive technologies in defiance of its
obligations under international law. This situation was
a backdrop to the intensive and constructive
S/PV.5647
707-28152
deliberations that have led to this resolution
unanimously adopted today.
By adopting this resolution, we have continued
our incremental and proportionate approach, increasing
gradually the pressure on Iran to address the concerns
shared across the international community. We have
strengthened the restrictions on individuals closely
associated with Iran‚Äôs sensitive nuclear activities and
with its ballistic missile programme. We have
prohibited arms sales from Iran and urge vigilance over
the supply of heavy weapons to Iran. We have also
urged restraint in making finance available to the
Government of Iran.
I should clarify that the United Kingdom‚Äôs
undertaking and understanding that the new resolution
does not introduce any changes to the provisions in
paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006). The asset
freeze, therefore, does not prevent a person or entity
designated in the annexes to resolution 1737 (2006)
and to this resolution from making payments due under
a contract entered into force before that person or
entity was listed in cases covered by paragraph 15.
This resolution, building upon resolutions 1696
(2006) and 1737 (2006), sends a unanimous and
unambiguous signal to the Government and people of
Iran. To both, we say that we prefer and are committed
to the path of cooperation. But we say, also, that the
path of proliferation by Iran is not one that the
international community can accept. We want Iran to
make the right choice ‚Äî cooperation with the
international community, which requires the removal
of any doubt that Iran could develop nuclear weapons.
The resolve of the Council is clear. Iran must make its
choice.
Mr. De La Sabli√®re (France) (spoke in French):
France welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
1747 (2007). As was unequivocally demonstrated in
the last report of the Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has
failed to suspend its enrichment and reprocessing
activities, nor has it suspended its heavy water
activities, including the construction of a heavy water
reactor at Arak. Nor has Iran resumed its cooperation
with the IAEA under the optional protocol. Thus, Iran
has ignored the resolutions of the IAEA Board of
Governors and the demands and decisions contained in
Security Council resolutions 1696 (2006) and 1737
(2006). As is affirmed in resolution 1737 (2006),
however, these measures are essential to build
confidence.
The international community is concerned about
the proliferation questions raised by the Iranian nuclear
programme. It is worrying that after several years of
investigation the International Atomic Energy Agency
is still unable to provide the international community
with the assurances it requires with respect to the
strictly peaceful nature of this programme. Essential
questions, including questions that may have possible
military nuclear implications in the very words of the
reports submitted by the Director General of the IAEA,
remain unanswered.
Nobody in this Council wishes to deny Iran its
rights or to prevent the Iranian people from benefiting
from nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. All States
parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) have the right to the peaceful
use of nuclear energy as long as they meet the
non-proliferation obligations derived from articles I, II
and III of the NPT. What the international community
asks of Iran is that it fulfil these non-proliferation
obligations. It is unacceptable that the Iranian
authorities find pretexts to shirk their commitments
made under the NPT.
By adopting resolution 1737 (2006), the Security
Council clearly indicated that it would suspend the
sanctions put in place if Iran reverted to the complete
suspension of all its enrichment and reprocessing
activities. It also warned Iran, however, that it would
take further measures, should Iran persist in its refusal
to meet the demands of the international community.
The last report of the Director General of the
IAEA clearly showed that the Iranian leaders did not
make the choice that the international community had
hoped for. In the circumstances, the Security Council
had no choice but to act.
The measures that the Security Council has
adopted today are proportionate to Iran‚Äôs actions. They
are reversible. They are in line with the approach of
progressively increasing the pressure applied by the
Council for more than a year, in order to persuade the
Iranian leaders to return to the conditions for
negotiation and to restrict the development of the
sensitive programmes undertaken.
The additional measures that the Council has just
adopted target a series of entities and individuals
S/PV.5647
07-281528
involved in Iran‚Äôs proliferation programmes. They also
target individuals and entities linked to the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard, which plays a disturbing role in
Iran‚Äôs ongoing development of sensitive nuclear and
ballistic activities. They also address the Bank Sepah,
which was involved in the funding activities linked to
Iran‚Äôs ballistic programme. The resolution also
provides for an embargo on arms sales and transfers
from Iran. It calls on all States to exercise vigilance
and restraint in their transfers of conventional weapons
to this country and not to enter into any new financial
assistance to the Iranian Government in the form of
subsidized loans or commitments for grants, in
particular. This appeal also applies to international
financial organizations.
These measures have been established in order to
exert effective pressure on the Iranian authorities,
while seeking to penalize the Iranian people as little as
possible. The new resolution does not introduce ‚Äî and
on this point, I am also expressing the position held by
the Federal Republic of Germany ‚Äî any change in the
provisions contained in paragraph 15 of resolution
1737 (2006). The asset freeze, therefore, does not
prevent a person or an entity designated in the annexes
to Security Council resolution 1737 (2006) and to this
resolution from making payments due under a contract
that entered into force before that person or entity was
listed in cases covered by paragraph 15 of resolution
1737 (2006).
As I said to this Council on 23 December last,
and as was affirmed by the President of the French
Republic, Iran has a choice between meeting the
demands of the international community and facing
growing isolation.
There is another path available to the Iranian
leaders that is different from the one on which they
have embarked: the path of negotiation, in good faith,
in the context of a discussion on the basis of the
proposals submitted to Iran by the group of six
countries last June. Those proposals are substantial and
highly advantageous for Iran. They recognize Iran‚Äôs
inalienable right to benefit from nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes. They offer cooperation to develop
peaceful nuclear energy in Iran and to shape a new
relationship with that country.
That offer remains on the table. France and its
partners in the group of six countries are sincere in
their desire to reach a negotiated solution with Iran.
That readiness was recalled, on behalf of the ministers
of our six countries, by the Ambassador of the United
Kingdom immediately following the adoption of the
resolution. We hope that the Iranian leaders will heed
the call and that we will be able to return as soon as
possible to a path leading to a settlement that respects
the interests and concerns of all. That would be
beneficial for the Iranian people and would help to
preserve the integrity of the international non-
proliferation regime, which is a fundamental element
of our multilateral security framework.
Mr. Wolff (United States of America): The
United States is pleased that the Security Council has
once again unanimously taken action against what is
clearly a grave threat to international peace and
security. The Iranian leadership‚Äôs continued defiance of
the Council in failing to comply with resolutions 1696
(2006) and 1737 (2006) requires that we uphold our
responsibilities defined in the Charter of this esteemed
body and take necessary action. While we hope that
Iran responds to this resolution by complying with its
international legal obligations, the United States is
fully prepared to support additional measures in 60
days should Iran choose another course.
We are here today because of the decisions of
Iran‚Äôs leadership. Their actions include more than 20
years of deception of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA). A nuclear programme has been hidden
from the international community, in violation of the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT), a programme that slowly and incompletely is
emerging from the shadows, only because of the efforts
of international inspectors and outside groups.
Let me quote from paragraph 29 of the IAEA
Director General‚Äôs most recent report summing up the
basic problem:
‚Äúgiven the existence in Iran of activities
undeclared to the Agency for 20 years, it is
necessary for Iran to enable the Agency, through
maximum cooperation and transparency, to fully
reconstruct the history of Iran‚Äôs nuclear
programme. Without such cooperation and
transparency, the Agency will not be able to
provide assurances about the absence of
undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran
or about the exclusively peaceful nature of that
programme.‚Äù (S/2007/100, annex, enclosure)
S/PV.5647
907-28152
The unanimous adoption today of resolution 1747
(2007) sends a clear and unambiguous message to Iran:
the regime‚Äôs continued pursuit of a nuclear-weapons
capability, in violation of its treaty obligations as well
as its obligations as a State Member of the United
Nations, will only further isolate Iran and make it less,
not more, secure.
In the light of that history, it is not only
appropriate, but the responsibility of the Security
Council, to act. And we have done so in a careful and
deliberate manner. In July of last year, we adopted
resolution 1696 (2006), which demanded that Iran
verifiably suspend all its uranium enrichment-related
and reprocessing activities and cooperate fully with the
steps required by the International Atomic Energy
Agency. That resolution was ignored by Iran.
Resolution 1737 (2006), adopted unanimously last
December, took appropriate action against the regime
in the light of the failure by Iran‚Äôs leadership to comply
with the decisions of the Council. It, too, was ignored
by Iran. Instead, Iran has expanded its enrichment
activities and continued construction of the heavy-
water research reactor at Arak, while scaling back even
further its cooperation with the IAEA.
Iran called the Council‚Äôs decisions invalid and an
extralegal act, and vowed that the new resolution
would not be an obstacle in the way of Iran‚Äôs nuclear
progress. Sadly, Iran continues to defy the will of the
international community, the decisions of this Council
and its obligations under international law. For that
reason it is entirely appropriate and necessary that we
have adopted stronger measures to persuade the regime
to make its country more secure by abandoning its
pursuit of nuclear weapons. Should Iran choose a
different path, this resolution makes clear that we are
prepared and willing to adopt additional measures.
Indeed, in the face of Iran‚Äôs continued defiance, the
United States expects that the Council will continue to
incrementally increase pressure on the Iranian
Government.
Let me be clear, though, to the Iranian people:
these measures that we are adopting today are in no
way meant to punish the civilian population of Iran.
Resolution 1747 (2007) is properly tailored to target
Iranian institutions and officials that support Iran‚Äôs
nuclear and missile programmes. It forbids Iran to
provide any arms to anyone, anywhere, and calls on all
nations not to export to Iran any major arms. The world
has benefited greatly from the rich, vibrant culture that
the people of Iran have to offer. My own country is
proud to be home to hundreds of thousands citizens
and residents of Iranian origin, and we are fortunate to
benefit from their many contributions to our society.
We hope for a different dynamic with Iran. As
President Bush has stated,
‚ÄúIran now has an opportunity to make its choice.
I would hope they would make the choice that
most of the free world wants them to make,
which is there is no need to have a weapons
programme; there is no need to isolate your
people. It is not in your interest to do so. And
should they agree to verifiably suspend their
enrichment, the United States will be at the table
with our partners.‚Äù
The decisions of the Iranian leadership, however,
required the Council to act. It is our solemn
responsibility to take measures which will not only halt
the development of Iran‚Äôs nuclear weapons programme,
but encourage the leadership of Iran to choose a
different path, which will benefit the entire Iranian
nation ‚Äî including its Government-professed
aspiration for nuclear energy.
With respect to the measures adopted today, we
would also like to note our understanding that the new
resolution does not introduce any changes to the
provisions contained in paragraph 15 of resolution
1737 (2006). The asset freeze, therefore, does not
prevent a person or entity designated in the annexes to
resolution 1737 (2006) and resolution 1747 (2007)
from making payments due under a contract entered
into before that person or entity was listed in those
cases covered by paragraph 15.
The Iranian leadership has claimed that this
Council seeks to deprive Iran of its right to peaceful
nuclear energy ‚Äî and we may hear that again today.
That is simply not true. The six Governments,
including my own, that have been trying in vain to get
to negotiations with the Iranians over the past year
recognize Iran‚Äôs right to peaceful, civil nuclear energy
in conformity with all articles and obligations of the
NPT. In fact, the generous proposal put on the table by
the six parties last June ‚Äî an offer that remains on the
table today ‚Äî includes assistance in the construction
of civilian light-water nuclear power plants. These
plants would generate electricity for the people of Iran
but be of no use to Iran‚Äôs nuclear weapons programme.
Many other Governments around the world, including
S/PV.5647
07-2815210
some represented on this Council, enjoy national
civilian nuclear energy programmes without any
difficulties, demonstrating that there is no
incompatibility between a country‚Äôs right to a peaceful
nuclear energy programme and its non-proliferation
obligations.
Iran‚Äôs rejection of this offer sends a deeply
troubling signal to the entire international community.
Nonetheless, my Government also associates itself
with the statement read by the United Kingdom
reaffirming our offer and willingness to resolve this
issue through negotiations.
The current path chosen by Iran‚Äôs leadership
poses a direct challenge to the very principles on which
the United Nations was founded. Iran‚Äôs leadership
openly proclaims that the Council is ‚Äúillegal‚Äù and that
its resolutions are ‚Äútorn pieces of paper‚Äù. Iran‚Äôs
Supreme Leader has pledged that Iran would undertake
‚Äúillegal acts‚Äù if the Council proceeded with the
adoption of this resolution. Article 2 of the Charter
makes clear that all Members shall refrain in their
international relations from the threat or use of force
against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any State. Calls by Iran‚Äôs leaders to
have Israel, a State Member of the United Nations,
‚Äúwiped off the map‚Äù stand in stark contrast to
everything for which this body stands. That contrast is
amplified by Iran‚Äôs continued well-known role as one
of the world‚Äôs leading State sponsors of terrorism.
The United Nations was born from the ashes and
horrific events of the Second World War and the
Holocaust. Sadly, we have seen attempts by Iran‚Äôs
President to question the undeniable tragedies that
unfolded during that period. That is why it was so
significant that the General Assembly established a
formal day of remembrance of the Holocaust, in
addition to its adoption by consensus of a resolution
rejecting denials of the Holocaust. To forget the past,
or, even worse, to attempt to rewrite it is to invite it to
be repeated, and we cannot allow that to happen.
In a few moments, we will hear from the Iranian
delegation. In the past, we have heard Iranian
representatives profess Iran‚Äôs peaceful intentions,
claim ‚Äî incorrectly ‚Äî violations of Iran‚Äôs rights,
argue about so-called double standards, and raise other
false claims designed to distract the international
community and world opinion from the issue at
hand ‚Äî that is, Iran‚Äôs non-compliance with its
obligations. We hope that the Iranian delegation‚Äôs
presence here reflects its Government‚Äôs understanding
of the weight that should be attached to the decisions
of the Council and the binding obligations that Iran has
a Member of the Organization under Article 25 of the
Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the
Security Council. We look forward to their response
and hope that their message is one that the Council and
the entire international community can embrace.
Anything less would signal continued disregard and
disdain for the body to which they are here to speak.
In closing, let me reiterate that the United States
remains firmly committed to finding a peaceful and
diplomatic solution to resolve what we all feel is a
grave threat to international peace and security. While
we regret the need for this resolution, our vote here
today shows that the Council can and will act
accordingly when countries violate their international
obligations. We look forward to Iran‚Äôs full compliance
with this resolution, which would signal its willingness
to engage in constructive negotiations over the future
of its nuclear programme. Such negotiations, if
successfully completed, will have profound and
tangible benefits for Iran, and, most importantly, for
the Iranian people.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): Russia voted in favour of the draft resolution
submitted to the Security Council. The text was the
outcome of the collective efforts of all the members of
the Security Council and the concrete result of
intensive consultations and complicated compromises.
We are pleased to note that the intensive process of
working on the text, in which the views expressed and
proposals made by members of the Council were taken
on board, has led to a text that is much more balanced
and coherent in terms of the goals it sets out to
achieve, compared to the initial draft.
The restrictions introduced by the resolution on
cooperation with Iran, like those contained in the
provisions of resolution 1737 (2006), are aimed at
eliminating the concerns that the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) still has on the Iranian nuclear
programme. These restrictions are in no way aimed at
punishing Iran. The Council‚Äôs decision has sent an
unequivocal message to Tehran on the need for full
cooperation with the IAEA and the Security Council.
At the same time, the content of resolution 1747 (2007)
is unambiguous in that the door to negotiations with
Iran remains open.
S/PV.5647
1107-28152
Of key significance in that context is the
provision contained in the resolution stating that if Iran
suspends all its activities related to the enrichment and
reprocessing of uranium during the negotiations period,
the implementation of the measures imposed by the
Security Council also will be suspended. Furthermore,
the text of the resolution clearly sets out the possibility
of revoking these measures.
Another very important point: these measures,
just as in resolution 1737 (2006), have been imposed in
accordance with Article 41 of the Charter and
consequently preclude the possibility of the use of
force. One of the provisions of the resolution stipulates
that any further steps taken by the Security Council, if
necessary, will also be exclusively peaceful ones. We
remain convinced that the effective resolution of the
Iranian nuclear problem can be achieved only through
political and diplomatic efforts.
We deem of great significance the fact that the
new resolution does not in any way alter the provisions
of paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006). The
freezing of financial activities will therefore not
prevent payments from being made by the natural or
legal persons listed in the annexes to resolution 1737
(2006) or in the resolution just adopted, payments
under contracts entered into before the aforementioned
persons were included on the list on the grounds
outlined in paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006). In
other words, the activities authorized by the Security
Council in the area of trade and economic cooperation
can continue.
Russia initiated and fully supports the statement
made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the group
of six countries, which is being made public in parallel
with the adoption of resolution 1747 (2007) and was
read out today on behalf of the group of six by the
Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom.
It is clear that the way the situation develops in
future will depend largely on Iran‚Äôs actions. We hope
that the Government of Iran will take into account the
unanimous adoption of resolution 1747 (2007),
carefully analyse the positive content of the statement
made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the six
countries, and, ultimately, choose fully to cooperate
with the IAEA, through a dialogue based on mutual
respect, on any other outstanding issues. Such a
constructive approach by the Iranian Government
would make it possible for us to put any unresolved
problems behind us and create a situation in which the
attitude taken towards Iran in its development of a
peaceful nuclear programme would be the same as
towards any other State party to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
Russia will continue to contribute to achieving
that aim in the interests of strengthening the nuclear
non-proliferation regime and strengthening regional
and international security.
Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China has consistently supported the safeguarding of
the international nuclear non-proliferation mechanism
and opposed the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We
do not wish to see fresh turbulence in the Middle East.
We are in favour of a peaceful solution to the issue of
Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme through political and
diplomatic efforts and negotiations.
Developments related to Iran‚Äôs nuclear
programme are currently a source of concern. China
respects and recognizes Iran‚Äôs right to the peaceful use
of nuclear energy. However, we are also disappointed
that the Iranian side has failed to respond positively to
the requests of the International Atomic Energy Agency
and the Security Council. Under these circumstances,
we support the Security Council‚Äôs taking of further,
appropriate actions aimed at urging the Iranian side to
suspend enrichment-related activities in order to bring
the process back onto the negotiation track.
At the same time, China believes that any
measure taken should aim at safeguarding the
international non-proliferation mechanism and at
maintaining international and regional peace and
stability. Actions taken by the Security Council should
be appropriate, incremental and proportionate. They
should help enhance diplomatic efforts rather than
aggravate conflicts and lead to confrontation. Given
that the resolution that has just been adopted basically
reflected the views of China that I have just expressed,
we voted in favour of it.
It needs to be pointed out that the purpose of the
new resolution is not to punish Iran but to urge it to
return to negotiations and reactivate diplomatic efforts.
The relevant sanctions measures should neither harm
the Iranian people nor affect normal economic, trade
and financial exchanges between Iran and other
countries. The new resolution does not introduce any
change to the exemption provisions contained in
paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006). The assets
S/PV.5647
07-2815212
freeze therefore does not prevent a person or entity
designated in the annexes to resolution 1737 (2006)
and this new resolution from making payments due
under contracts entered into before that person or entity
was listed in cases covered by paragraph 15.
The new resolution and the sanctions measures in
resolution 1737 (2006) are all reversible. If Iran
suspends its enrichment-related and reprocessing
activities and complies with the relevant resolutions of
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
the Security Council, the Security Council shall
suspend, and even terminate, the sanctions measures.
It is impossible to resolve the issue
fundamentally by imposing sanctions and pressure
only. Diplomatic talks remain the best option. That is
also the common understanding of the international
community. A solution to the Iranian nuclear issue
requires all-around diplomatic efforts, especially
diplomatic efforts outside the Security Council. We
wish to call upon all the parties concerned to adopt a
highly responsible and constructive attitude, keep
calm, practice restraint and refrain from any actions
that may lead to deterioration or the escalation of
tensions. At the same time, we should bear in mind the
following principles in seeking solutions to the Iran
nuclear issue.
First, in handling the Iran nuclear issue,
safeguarding international non-proliferation
mechanisms and maintaining international and regional
peace and stability remain the premise and ultimate
objective. No actions should deviate from that goal.
Secondly, it is essential to keep the process on the
path of dialogue and negotiation and to insist on
seeking a peaceful solution through political and
diplomatic efforts. It is therefore particularly important
to reinforce diplomatic efforts outside the Security
Council.
Thirdly, we should firmly safeguard the
international non-proliferation mechanism. The IAEA
remains the main framework for solving the Iran
nuclear issue. Its authority and role should therefore be
safeguarded and strengthened.
Fourthly, it is necessary to handle, in a balanced
manner, the relations between the peaceful use of
nuclear energy and non-proliferation. The international
community should recognize Iran‚Äôs right to the
peaceful use of nuclear energy. Iran also has the
obligation to accept effective supervision by the IAEA
and to resolve outstanding issues through cooperation
with the IAEA, so as to prove the peaceful nature of its
nuclear programme and establish international
confidence in that regard.
Fifthly, all the parties concerned should act on the
basis of equality and mutual respect, strengthen
dialogue and communication, increase trust, reduce
doubts and remove each other‚Äôs concerns, so as to
create the necessary atmosphere and conditions for the
settlement of this issue.
Sixthly, the current urgent task for all the parties
is to show full flexibility and creatively seek to resume
negotiations. The June 2006 proposal put forward by
the six countries is still on the table. The time-out
proposal by IAEA Director General ElBaradei and the
establishment of a mechanism for talks that includes
Iran also deserve our consideration.
China is ready to work with other parties to
continue to play its due role for a comprehensive and
peaceful solution to the Iran nuclear issue.
Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): Panama
understands its participation in the Security Council to
be a fiduciary responsibility to the Members and
organizations of the United Nations to promote
international peace and security. In that context,
Panama is pleased that the Security Council was able
to act unanimously in sending a message of clear
concern to the people and Government of Iran as
regards their nuclear programme.
Nevertheless, whenever the Council adopts a
resolution to impose sanctions, that clearly is a failure
of the political process. Panama therefore calls upon all
parties to launch as soon as possible a negotiations
process aimed at resolving the conflict that prompted
the Security Council to act today. Panama has taken
note of the fact that all parties have acknowledged that
Iran has a right to use nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes, and that like all other parties to the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons it also has
an obligation to prevent the same.
Panama therefore understands that all that is
lacking is determination and good faith in order to
understand and share the concern of the international
community.
Mr. Matulay (Slovakia): As a country producing
and using nuclear energy to produce electricity,
S/PV.5647
1307-28152
Slovakia supports the right of every country to use
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in conformity
with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT). Based on its strict adherence to the
NPT and to the statute of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), my Government would never
support any action that would infringe upon that
inalienable right of States.
However, we are fully convinced that the
international community is right to ask for guarantees
as to the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran‚Äôs nuclear
programme. The fact is that we still do not have those
assurances. The IAEA remains unable to make further
progress in its efforts to fully verify the past
development of Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme and certain
aspects of its scope and nature. We urge Iran to provide
maximum cooperation and transparency to the IAEA
and to all partners concerned to solve all outstanding
issues and restore confidence about its nuclear
programme.
For nearly four years, the IAEA has been
investigating Iran‚Äôs undeclared nuclear activities. As a
result of its findings, in September 2005 the IAEA
Board of Governors found that Iran‚Äôs many failures and
breaches of its obligations to comply with its NPT
safeguards agreement constituted non-compliance in
the context of the Agency‚Äôs statute. In February 2006,
the Board of Governors, meeting in extraordinary
session, requested the IAEA Director General to report
Iran‚Äôs dossier to the Security Council.
The Security Council acted on this serious matter
by passing legally binding resolutions 1696 (2006),
1737 (2007) and 1747 (2007) ‚Äî the latter having been
adopted unanimously today. Slovakia supported them
all because they are proportionate, incremental and
targeted responses to Iran‚Äôs continued failure to comply
with international requirements as originally expressed
by the IAEA Board of Governors.
Slovakia reaffirms its continuous support for
efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the
Iranian nuclear issue. We fully share the view that
every diplomatic effort must be explored and exhausted
to achieve that goal. A proposal for a long-term
comprehensive agreement presented to Iran last June is
still on the table, and the door to negotiations remains
open. We believe that it offers Iran the chance to reach
a negotiated agreement based on cooperation. In that
respect, we welcome the new ministerial declaration of
the E3 + 3 that has been issued today and presented by
the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom.
In view of the above and our desire for a
comprehensive and peaceful solution to this issue my
delegation calls upon the Iranian leadership to comply
with Security Council requirements and resume
negotiations on terms acceptable to the international
community.
Finally, my country has great respect for the
nation of Iran, its rich history and ancient culture. We
therefore hope that Iran will seize the opportunity to
choose the right path towards a comprehensive long-
term solution to its nuclear programme that will result
in peaceful nuclear cooperation and positive
development of relations with the entire international
community in the future.
Mr. Verbeke (Belgium) (spoke in French):
Belgium voted in favour of resolution 1747 (2007) and
welcomes its unanimous adoption. Belgium regrets that
Iran has not met the requirements of the Security
Council by suspending its uranium-enrichment
activities as well as its work on all heavy-water-related
projects. Belgium deplores the lack of cooperation and
transparency on the part of Iran that led the
International Atomic Energy Agency to conclude, on
22 January, that it was not in a position to provide
assurances about the absence of undeclared nuclear
material and activities in Iran or the exclusively
peaceful purpose of its nuclear programme.
The new resolution serves to demonstrate the
resolve of the international community to monitor the
integrity of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and
also reaffirms its desire to create the framework within
which to search for a negotiated solution.
In that regard, Belgium launches a strong appeal
to Iran to pay due heed to the offer made to it in June
2006, in order to implement a long-term and lasting
agreement.
The new resolution reflects the unanimous
resolve expressed by the Security Council, as stated in
resolution 1737 (2006) and reaffirmed in the current
resolution, to take appropriate additional measures
since Iran has ignored the requirements of the Security
Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
We attach particular importance to the principles of
proportionality and reversibility that are provided for
within the resolution. Those principles reflect the
S/PV.5647
07-2815214
resolve of the Council, while indicating to Iran that
another path remains open.
Mr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): Ghana has joined
the consensus on Security Council resolution 1747
(2007) because we believe in the non-proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. Although the resolution
that has just been adopted imposes sanctions on Iran,
we are heartened by the fact that it leaves the door
open to negotiations and that the stipulated measures
are reversible. We continue to believe and hope that
there will be a diplomatic solution to the protracted
negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, my delegation wishes to use the occasion
to appeal to all States to live up to their international
obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons: non-proliferation, the right to the
peaceful use of nuclear energy and nuclear
disarmament. We recognize the sensitivity of the issue.
However, I hope the Council will pay attention to the
issue of selectivity ‚Äî which has been raised by some
of our colleagues during the course of the debate ‚Äî if
the international community is to succeed in checking
the spread of and eliminating weapons of mass
destruction.
The President: It is now my honour to give the
floor to His Excellency Mr. Manouchehr Motaki,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of
Iran. On behalf of the Security Council, I extend to him
a warm welcome and invite him to take the floor.
Mr. Motaki (Islamic Republic of Iran) (spoke in
Persian; English text provided by the delegation): This
is the fourth time in the last 12 months that, in an
unwarranted move orchestrated by a few of its
permanent members, the Security Council is being
abused to take an unlawful, unnecessary and
unjustifiable action against the peaceful nuclear
programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which
presents no threat to international peace and security
and therefore falls outside the Council‚Äôs Charter-based
mandate.
As we have stressed time and again, Iran‚Äôs
nuclear programme is completely peaceful. We have
expressed our readiness, taken unprecedented steps and
offered several serious proposals to address and allay
any possible concern in that regard. Indeed, there has
been no doubt on our part from the beginning, nor
should there be any on the part of the Council, that all
the schemes of the sponsors of the resolution are
dictated by narrow national considerations and are
aimed at depriving the Iranian people of their
inalienable rights, rather than emanating from any so-
called proliferation concerns.
In order to give this scheme a semblance of
international legitimacy, its initiators first manipulated
the Board of Governors of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) and ‚Äî as they acknowledged
themselves ‚Äî coerced some of its members to vote
against Iran on the Board, and then have taken
advantage of their substantial economic and political
power to pressure and manipulate the Security Council
to adopt three unwarranted resolutions within
8 months.
Undoubtedly, those resolutions cannot indicate
universal acceptance, particularly when the heads of
State of the nearly two thirds of the States Members of
the United Nations that also belong to the Non-Aligned
Movement and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) supported Iran‚Äôs position as recently
as September 2006 and expressed concern about the
policies pursued within the Security Council. Those
resolutions do not even reflect the views of the
Council‚Äôs own 15 members, since most of them were
not thoroughly informed about ‚Äî let alone engaged
in ‚Äî the discussions held in secret meetings where
only a few parties, among them non-Council members,
made decisions for the entire Council.
This is not the first time that the Security Council
has asked Iran to relinquish its rights. When Saddam
Hussein invaded Iran 27 years ago, the Council waited
seven days so that Iraq could occupy 30,000 square
kilometres of Iranian territory. Then it unanimously
adopted resolution 479 (1980). That unanimously
adopted resolution asked the two sides to stop the
hostilities, without asking the aggressor to withdraw.
That is, the Council ‚Äî at that time as well ‚Äî
effectively asked Iran to suspend some of its rights, in
that case, its right to approximately 30,000 square
kilometres of its territory.
As expected, the aggressor dutifully complied.
But imagine what would have happened if Iran had
complied. If we had, we would still be begging the
Council‚Äôs then-sweetheart, President Saddam Hussein,
to return our territory. We did not agree to suspend our
right to our territory. We resisted eight years of carnage
and use of chemical weapons, coupled with pressure
S/PV.5647
1507-28152
from the Council and sanctions from its permanent
members.
In the course of the war, the United States joined
the United Kingdom, Germany, France and the Soviet
Union, along with other Western countries, in
providing Saddam with military hardware and
intelligence and even with the material for chemical
and biological weapons. For several years, and despite
mounting evidence and United Nations reports, the
Security Council was prevented from dealing with
Iraq‚Äôs use of chemical weapons against Iranian
civilians and military personnel.
I am confident that today, most of the permanent
members of the Council do not even want to remember
that travesty of justice, the Charter and international
law, let alone blame Iran for non-compliance with
resolution 479 (1980). I am also confident that they do
not want to remember that when the Iranian people
nationalized their oil industry, they attempted to
impose a resolution on the Council condemning Iran
for threatening peace and security. But they cannot
force international public opinion to forget that, and
the Iranian people will certainly never forget it.
Who among you does not know ‚Äî and rest
assured, international public opinion does know ‚Äî that
for more than a month, two members of the Council,
with full and prior knowledge of the Zionist regime‚Äôs
intention to commit aggression against Lebanon,
prevented any decision in this Council, the Rome
Conference, and any initiatives to put an end to that
regime‚Äôs atrocities? You in the Council could not even
adopt an appropriate position vis-√†-vis the bombing of
United Nations facilities in Lebanon, which caused the
death of your own representatives.
The Security Council should be held accountable
not only for its unlawful actions and decisions, but
indeed for its repeated failures to act against threats to
international peace and security.
As an organ of an international Organization
created by States, the Security Council is bound by
law, and Member States have every right to insist that
the Council keep within the powers that they accorded
it under the Charter of the United Nations. The
Security Council must exercise those powers
consistently with the purposes and principles of the
Charter. Equally, the measures it takes must be
consistent with the purposes and principles of the
United Nations and with other international law.
Members of the Security Council do not have the right
to undermine the Council‚Äôs credibility.
There is every reason to assert that the Security
Council‚Äôs consideration of the Iranian peaceful nuclear
programme has no legal basis, since the referral of the
case to the Council and then the adoption of resolutions
fail to meet the minimum standards of legality. Iran‚Äôs
peaceful nuclear activities cannot, by any stretch of
law, fact or logic, be characterized as a threat to peace.
Rather, certain members of the Security Council
decided to hijack the case from the IAEA, the principal
specialized technical organ in charge of the issue, and
to politicize it.
How can Iran‚Äôs peaceful nuclear programme be
considered in the Security Council while Iran has
carried out all its obligations and cooperated to the
fullest extent possible, far more than it is obliged to do
in accordance with its treaty obligations, namely those
under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT) and the Safeguards Agreement? Is it
not simply because the IAEA could not find any
diversion from lawful and peaceful purposes? How
could one expect the IAEA to prove a negative fact?
In order to achieve the politically motivated and
unlawful goal of depriving Iran of its inalienable right
to nuclear technology, attempts have been made to
manufacture evidence. According to a recent report in
an American newspaper, ‚Äúmost United States
intelligence shared with the United Nations nuclear
watchdog agency has proved inaccurate and none has
led to significant discoveries inside Iran‚Äù. The same
news article also quotes a senior IAEA official as
saying ‚Äúsince 2002, pretty much all the intelligence
that‚Äôs come to us has proved to be wrong‚Äù.
However, in order to enable the IAEA to reach
this conclusion, Iran had to implement transparency
measures outside all IAEA safeguards and protocols
and allow the IAEA inspectors to make over 20 visits
to its sensitive military sites which had no connection
whatsoever with its nuclear programme.
Would any member of this Council agree to do
likewise? Are the permanent members of this Council
even prepared to inform the international public of the
number of centrifuges they own? In fact, over the last
four years, the IAEA has conducted more than 2,100
person-days of scrutiny of all Iranian nuclear facilities.
All reports by the IAEA since November 2003 until
now have been indicative of the peaceful nature of the
S/PV.5647
07-2815216
Iranian nuclear programme. The Agency confirmed in
2003, and has maintained since then, that to date, there
is no evidence that the previously undeclared nuclear
material and activities were related to a nuclear
weapons programme.
On several occasions, the Agency concluded that
all the declared nuclear material in Iran has been
accounted for, and therefore such material is not
diverted to prohibited activities. As recently as
February 2007, the IAEA Director General stated in his
report (S/2007/100, annex, enclosure) that ‚Äúpursuant to
its NPT Safeguards Agreement, Iran has been
providing the Agency with access to declared nuclear
material and facilities, and has provided the required
nuclear material accountancy reports in connection
with such material and facilities‚Äù. The same report also
indicates that ‚Äúthe Agency is able to verify the non-
diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran‚Äù. The
Director General also indicated to the Board of
Governors on 5 March 2007 that the Agency has seen
no ‚Äúindustrial capacity to produce weapon-usable
nuclear material, which is an important consideration
in assessing the risk‚Äù.
It is very unfortunate that the Security Council,
under the manifest pressure of a few of its permanent
members, persists in trying to deprive a nation of its
‚Äúinalienable right‚Äù to develop nuclear technology for
peaceful purposes, while that nation has met, and
continues to honour, its international obligations. The
Security Council‚Äôs decision to try to coerce Iran into
suspension of its peaceful nuclear programme is a
gross violation of Article 25 of the Charter of the
United Nations and contradicts the Iranian people‚Äôs
right to development and right to education.
While Member States have agreed, in accordance
with Article 25 of the Charter, to accept and carry out
the decisions of the Security Council in accordance
with the present Charter, the Security Council cannot
pressure countries into submitting either to its
decisions taken in bad faith or to its demands negating
the fundamental purposes and principles of the Charter
of the United Nations.
Likewise, as the International Court of Justice
held in its 1971 Advisory Opinion, Member States are
required to comply with its decisions only if they are in
accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
Does the Charter authorize the Security Council to
require States Members of the United Nations to give
up their basic rights emanating from treaties? To do
that would violate established principles of
international treaty law and the principle set forth in
the Preamble to the Charter, namely, to establish
conditions under which justice and respect for treaty
obligations are to be maintained.
Who could deny that depriving a whole nation of
higher education in specific fields and of the benefits
of nuclear technology for humanitarian and civil uses
is contrary to the basic right of all people to education
and development? Is not that an alarmingly
discriminatory approach vis-√†-vis knowledge and
development? How could an organ of the United
Nations, established to maintain peace and security, be
manipulated by certain States not only to act contrary
to the fundamental purposes and principles of the
Charter, but also to aggravate an issue that could be
easily resolved into an international crisis? However, it
is evident that such an approach will strengthen the
resolve of developing countries to expedite their
independence-seeking efforts and attain even greater
scientific and technological achievements.
Although those who voted in favour of the
resolution just adopted concerning Iran‚Äôs peaceful
nuclear programme did not even bother to listen to my
country‚Äôs positions and explanations before the vote, I
would like to highlight a number of elements of that
resolution for the record and for the awakened global
public opinion.
First, by establishing sanctions, the resolution is
punishing a country that, according to the IAEA, has
never diverted its nuclear programme. The resolution
punishes a country that has been a committed party to
the NPT, with all of its nuclear facilities monitored by
IAEA inspectors and their cameras. The resolution
imposes sanctions on a country that has fulfilled all of
its commitments under the NPT and the IAEA
safeguards, and demands nothing more than its
inalienable rights under the Treaty. Could there be any
better way to undermine an important multilateral
instrument that deals directly with international peace
and security? Is not this action by the Security Council,
in and of itself, a grave threat to international peace
and security?
Secondly, the resolution clearly departs from the
stated claims of its sponsors. By targeting my country‚Äôs
defence, economic and educational institutions, it is
pursuing objectives far beyond Iran‚Äôs peaceful nuclear
S/PV.5647
1707-28152
programme. The sanctions provided for in the
resolution are clearly targeting an independent, proud
and tireless nation with thousands of years of culture
and civilization. What can the harming of hundreds of
thousands of depositors in Bank Sepah, which has an
80-year history in Iran, mean other than a confrontation
with ordinary Iranians?
Thirdly, the resolution has been adopted at a time
when not only have all rational proposals and
initiatives to return to a negotiated solution been
neglected, but also certain countries have not even
allowed such proposals to be presented. Iran has
always been ready for time-bound and unconditional
negotiations aimed at finding a mutually acceptable
solution. Iran has done its best to achieve that objective
and has presented numerous proposals to provide
necessary assurances about the peaceful nature of its
nuclear programme. In the past several weeks, other
proposals have been advanced, each of which could
have provided an opportunity to break the current
stalemate and to lead to a rational and just resolution.
The only interpretation that can be made of the rush to
adopt this resolution and prevent negotiations is that
there are ulterior motives on the part of the sponsors
and a lack of political will to find solutions.
Finally, the resolution has been adopted against
Iran‚Äôs peaceful nuclear programme even as the major
nuclear powers continue to flout the persistent demand
of the international community for nuclear
disarmament and instead jeopardize international peace
and security by developing new generations of those
weapons and threatening to use them.
Does the adoption of the resolution strengthen
international peace and security? Does it enhance the
credibility of important international mechanisms such
as the NPT, the IAEA and even this very Council?
Does it increase the confidence of countries and
developing nations that they can attain their rights
through these mechanisms and instruments? Does it
increase trust in multilateral mechanisms? Does it
decrease unilateralist tendencies? Certainly the answer
to all of those questions is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. The only outcome of
the resolution is that freedom-loving people and
Governments throughout the world will gain
confidence that they cannot rely on multilateral
institutions to attain their legitimate rights.
Because of the unlawful and unjust approach of
the Security Council, its resolutions have so far failed
to lead to a settlement of the issue. Those resolutions,
and the certainty of some permanent members that they
can get them adopted one way or another, are, and
always have been, a part of the problem and an
impediment to finding a real and mutually acceptable
solution. That is why Iran continues to insist on the
imperative of stopping this practice, which will only
exacerbate the situation and will erode the authority
and undermine the credibility of the Council.
It has been clear from the outset that there are
only two alternatives in dealing with Iran‚Äôs peaceful
nuclear programme: cooperation and interaction, or
confrontation and conflict. The Islamic Republic of
Iran, confident of the peaceful nature of its nuclear
programme, has always insisted on the first alternative.
Iran does not seek confrontation, nor does it want
anything beyond its inalienable rights. I can assure the
Council that pressure and intimidation will not change
Iranian policy. If certain countries have pinned their
hopes on the possibility that repeated resolutions would
weaken the resolve of the great Iranian nation, they
should not doubt that they have once again faced a
catastrophic intelligence and analytical failure vis-√†-vis
the Iranian people‚Äôs Islamic revolution.
Probably at no other time in Iran‚Äôs history have
its entire people been so solidly behind a national
demand. Just as the Iranian nation paid a heavy price
for the nationalization of its oil industry and its eight
years of sacred defence, we realize that we must now
be prepared to pay the price for our dignity and our
independence. But the world must know ‚Äî and it
does ‚Äî that even the harshest political and economic
sanctions or other threats are far too weak to coerce the
Iranian nation into retreating from its legal and
legitimate demands.
If you are seeking to sanction and block the
wealth and capabilities of the Iranian nation,
particularly with respect to our national heroes
mentioned in the resolution, then I will tell you what
our main assets are: faith in God, seeking justice, and
resisting threats and intimidation. Can this resolution
block these valuable assets? Were eight years of an
imposed war ‚Äî a war that was designed by certain
permanent members and implemented through an
endless supply of weapons and petrodollars, missiles,
Mirage and Super Etandard aircraft, intelligence
support and promises from the former United States
Secretary of Defence ‚Äî able to confiscate these great
assets?

The Iranian nation, following its esteemed leader,
advises you not to undermine the dignity of the United
Nations and of the IAEA. We invite you to return to the
correct path of negotiation, on the basis of truth and
justice. The only way forward is to abandon unwise
preconditions and return to the negotiating table in
good faith. Suspension is neither an option nor a
solution.
The great Iranian people, guided by Islamic
teachings and values, are a peace-loving and civilized
nation. It is a fact that our people have never had any
role in crimes against humanity such as the ones
committed during the last two world wars, the
genocides that have taken place in various parts of the
world, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tragedies, the Viet
Nam war, the crimes perpetrated during the war in the
Balkans, or the atrocious crimes that are being
systematically committed against the Palestinian
people. Iran has not started any war in the past 200
years. We have even been the victim of terrorism and
weapons of mass destruction during the eight-year war
imposed on us. We call for peace, stability and the
well-being of all peoples throughout the world,
especially in our own region. We have always
endeavoured to play a constructive and effective role as
a responsible member of the international community.
The President: There are no further speakers on
my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 5.15 p.m.
