The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan and
South Sudan
Report of the Secretary-General on the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur (S/2014/515)
The President: In accordance with rule 37 of
the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of the Sudan to participate in this
meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2014/515, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2014/628, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by France, the Republic of Korea, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Australia, Chad, Chile, China, France,
Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Nigeria, Republic
of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2173 (2014).
I now give the floor to the representative of the
Sudan.
Mr. Elnor (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like to begin by thanking you, Mr. President, for this
opportunity to comment on today’s resolution (2173
(2014), which renews the mandate of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID). In our view, however, the resolution does
not acknowledge all of the positive developments that
have occurred in Darfur over the past few months, as
detailed in the Secretary-General’s report on the subject
(S/2014/515). Much of the report clearly confirms the
ongoing stabilization in the five states that make up
Darfur. In addition, the statement made to the Council
by the Joint African Union-United Nations Special
Representative for Darfur, Mr. Mohamed Ibn Chambas
affirmed the same conclusions (see S/PV.7238).
We had hoped that a new resolution would have
focused on the stabilization process and on promoting
the resulting stability, based on implementation of
the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, as well as
on supporting and promoting UNAMID’s activities.
We have stated previously that Darfur has now moved
beyond the peacekeeping stage and into a phase of
stabilization, recovery and reconstruction, which is why
the UNAMID mandate should reflect the requirements
of that phase. The resolution should therefore have gone
beyond expressions of condemnation and concern, in
view of the fact that the security and humanitarian
situations are now stable.
My country entered a new phase since the initiative
taken on 27 January by the President of the Republic
of the Sudan, Mr. Omer Hassan Al-Bashir, to launch
the national dialogue that has now been established
throughout the country, as the Special Envoy of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Menkerios, has attested.
We appreciate today’s resolution, especially those
paragraphs that welcome the national dialogue and
condemn the rebel groups that try to hinder such
dialogue.
While today’s resolution renews UNAMID’s
mandate for 10 months, we are resolved to achieve
the objectives of our comprehensive national dialogue
before those 10 months are up, particularly in the area
of political inclusivity. We are determined to achieve
the goals of the comprehensive national dialogue before
those 10 months have elapsed, particularly in the light
of the positive political advances. We are determined to
bury the hatchet and let bygones be bygones; it is now
time to begin implementing paragraph 24 of resolution
1769 (2007).
We have turned the page on military confrontation
with certain rebel groups. Beyond our successful efforts
in containing tribal violence, we are determined to end
that chapter through reconciliation initiatives among
the tribes.

27/08/2014 Sudan and South Sudan S/PV.7250
the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, in
its 9 July communiqué, decided to extend UNAMID’s
mandate for 12 months and called on the Security
Council to act in a similar manner. While we welcome
the adoption of resolution 2173 (2014), Chad regrets
that the Security Council did not take into account
the request of the Peace and Security Council of the
African Union in its totality. We nevertheless believe
that, with the adoption of this resolution, the prevailing
humanitarian situation in Darfur will be improved due
to the mobilization of additional resources.
In addition, Chad calls on both Councils to
continue to work together in future as partners and
to take decisions to avoid controversies on issues of
key importance. Moreover, Chad believes that it is
important to continue to deal with the crisis in Darfur
in its regional dimension, in view of the repercussions
that it could have on the stability of neighbouring
countries. We welcome the fact that the resolution just
adopted takes those concerns into account.
We have always said that there is no military
solution to the crisis in Darfur and that we need to
promote a national dialogue, given that there has been
progress and hope. From that perspective, we call on
all players involved to refrain from any action that
could compromise the planned national dialogue and to
undertake a transparent, inclusive and holistic process
that makes it possible to promote peace and stability in
the Sudan.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.10 a.m.
In conclusion, political settlement is the best
solution. We are determined to promote inclusive
national dialogue in order to bring the efforts made in
favour of peace and stability in Darfur to a successful
conclusion. I wish to express thanks and appreciation
to all those who have made continuing efforts in recent
days in order to achieve peace and stability in Darfur.
We hope that the Security Council’s resolutions will
have a positive impact on the peace process.
The President: I shall now give the floor to the
member of the Security Council who wishes to make a
statement after the voting.
Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): My delegation
is pleased with the unanimous adoption of resolution
2173 (2014).
The Security Council and the international
community have not stood by with indifference with
respect to the ongoing deterioration of the security
and humanitarian situation in Darfur. Chad expresses
its deep concern over the tenuous security situation
impeding the daily operations of humanitarian agencies
on the ground and compromising the distribution of
humanitarian assistance and food to needy people. Chad
welcomes the efforts undertaken and the sacrifices
made by the African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) as it carries out its
mandate, in particular with respect to the protection
of civilians, facilitating the delivery of humanitarian
assistance, providing security for humanitarian workers
and undertaking mediation in the intercommunal
negotiations.
In order to enable the mission to contribute to the
protection of civilians and promote peace and security,
