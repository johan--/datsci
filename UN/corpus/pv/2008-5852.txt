to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of the Democratic Republic of the

to participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
