Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Timor-Leste
End of mandate report of the Secretary-General
on the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste
(S/2006/251)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Timor-Leste, in which she
requests to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate
in the consideration of the item, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Ms. Borges
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/251, which contains the text of an
end of mandate report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Office in Timor-Leste. Members of the
Council also have before them document S/2006/290,
which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in
the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
I wish to draw the attention of members to
document S/2006/230, containing the text of a letter
dated 10 April 2006 from Timor-Leste addressed to the
Secretary-General, transmitting a letter from the
President of Timor-Leste.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed on the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2006/290) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1677 (2006).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.20 a.m.
