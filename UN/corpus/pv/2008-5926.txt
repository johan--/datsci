Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Disengagement Observer Force
(S/2008/390)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/415, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations. Members of the Council also
before them document S/2008/390, which contains the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America,
Viet Nam
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1821 (2008).
In connection with the resolution just adopted on
the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force, I have been authorized
to make the following complementary statement on
behalf of the Security Council.
‚ÄúAs is known, the report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force (S/2008/390) states in
paragraph 11, ‚Äò... the situation in the Middle East
is tense and is likely to remain so, unless and
until a comprehensive settlement covering all
aspects of the Middle East problem can be
reached‚Äô. That statement of the Secretary-General
reflects the views of the Security Council.‚Äù
This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2008/25.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on the
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
