The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons
Responsible for Serious Violations of International
Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of
the Former Yugoslavia since 1991
Letter dated 31 July 2007 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the
Security Council (S/2007/538)
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/541, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations. I also wish to draw the attention of
the members to document S/2007/538, which contains
a letter dated 31 July 2007 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, China, Congo, France, Ghana,
Indonesia, Italy, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Slovakia,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America
Against:
None
Abstaining:
Russian Federation
The President (spoke in French): There were
14 votes in favour, none against and 1 abstention. The
draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 1775
(2007).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council wishing to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Rogachev (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation shares the
understanding reached in the Security Council on the
need to defer until the end of the present year the
consideration of the question of the appointment of a
new Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia. There were several possible
ways to resolve this generally technical issue.
However, the option introduced in the Security Council
seems to us to be the least successful one.
The Russian delegation has frequently expressed
doubts as to whether Ms. Del Ponte understands her
mandate properly. Instead of carrying out the
professional duties of a jurist employed by the
international community to support an impartial
prosecution in the Tribunal, the current Prosecutor’s
priority has become assuming the functions of some
kind of quasi-political player having the audacity to
write a prescription in the area of international
relations. This has been significantly assisted by the
fact that, in our eyes, the Tribunal has increasingly
assumed features of a non-transparent, biased and
costly organ of international justice.
The situation regarding the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia requires urgent
correction. We must pin our hopes on the new
Prosecutor of the Tribunal, who will assume the post in
three and a half months’ time.
Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): In
accordance with the two resolutions we have just
adopted, Mr. Jallow will be reappointed as Prosecutor
of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for
another four years and the mandate of Ms. Del Ponte as
the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia will be extended for three
months. I would like to express our congratulations to
them.
In their respective work over the past few years,
the two Prosecutors have worked diligently. Faced with
the completion strategies of the two Tribunals, their
responsibilities will be more demanding. We hope that
the two Prosecutors will continue to strive for greater
efficiency, fairness and justice in their work.

With regard to the Prosecutor of the International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the views
expressed by the representative of the Russian
Federation are understandable. However, given the fact
that the three-month extension is merely a transitional
arrangement, we are ready to respect the Secretary-
General’s nomination. As the Tribunal is under the
pressure of time with regard to the completion strategy,
it is even more imperative that the Prosecutor press
ahead with the prosecution, while managing all the
work related to the transition. She is also expected to
cooperate in ensuring the success of the completion
strategy and to establish a solid groundwork for her
successor.
Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I had not intended
to take the floor today, but in the light of the previous
explanations of vote, I wanted to place on record the
United Kingdom’s very strong support for the work of
the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
and of all its Prosecutors, and in particular for Ms. Del
Ponte.
Under Ms. Del Ponte’s stewardship of the
International Tribunal, the number of outstanding
fugitives has been reduced to a handful. I think that
that handful is actually numbered at four, though I am
open to correction. She has been responsible for seeing
delivered to the Tribunal some of the most prominent
indictees, including ones mentioned by name in this
Chamber. I am thinking in particular of General
Gotovina of Croatia. She has also been instrumental in
ensuring the voluntary surrender of Haradinaj from
Kosovo. Those are very important achievements.
We do not believe that it helps foster widespread
or regional support for the Tribunal for there to be any
question over the support of the Security Council for
its work. I say that particularly in the light of certain
statements from one country in the region,
undermining the work that the Tribunal has been doing.
One of the particular concerns we have is that we
hope that the two most prominent indictees
outstanding — they are, of course, Karadzic and
Mladic, who are indicted for the murder of over 7,000
Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995 — will not
gain any succour from the result today, or believe that
they can continue to challenge with impunity the will
of the Chamber, the will of this Council and the will, I
think, of the international community that they be
transferred speedily to The Hague.
I would just like to recall that, in 2003 and 2004,
we in this Chamber adopted two resolutions under
Chapter VII, making clear that, should Karadzic and
Mladic be transferred or apprehended at whatever stage
of the completion strategy, or even after the completion
strategy, they will be tried by the International Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia.
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
make a statement in my national capacity simply to
reaffirm France’s support for the work of Ms. Carla del
Ponte, its appreciation for her achievements at the
Tribunal, and its firm resolve to continue to cooperate
fully with the Tribunal in the pursuit of its tasks.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
