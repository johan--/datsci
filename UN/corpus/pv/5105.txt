Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Liberia
Letter dated 23 September 2004 from the
Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003)
concerning Liberia addressed to the President
of the Security Council (S/2004/752)
Letter dated 6 December 2004 from the
Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003)
concerning Liberia addressed to the President
of the Security Council (S/2004/955)
The President (spoke in Arabic): I would like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Liberia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Osode
(Liberia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2004/981, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by France, Germany, Romania,
Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
I would like to draw the attention of the members
to documents S/2004/752 and S/2004/955, containing
letters dated 23 September 2004 and 6 December 2004,
respectively, addressed to the President of the Security
Council, transmitting the midterm and final reports of
the Panel of Experts on Liberia.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objections, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America.
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1579 (2004).
I shall now call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements following the voting.
Mr. Holliday (United States of America): We
would like to thank Ambassador Akram for all his
work on this issue.
We are sponsoring this resolution as a statement
of our strong support of the ongoing efforts of the
United Nations to ensure peace and stability in Liberia
and the region, and its recognition that premature
lifting of sanctions at this time would threaten the re-
emergence of armed conflict.
We share the desire of other Council member
States to see Liberia’s timber sector restored quickly as
a source of legitimate revenue for the National
Transitional Government. However, to accomplish that
objective, we believe there must be security,
transparency and accountability in the timber sector. At
present, Liberia lacks the necessary institutional and
financial mechanisms to ensure that forest resources
are used for legitimate development.
Consistent with its desire to help Liberia quickly
re-establish the conditions under which forest
resources can be used for the benefit of the Liberian
people, the United States Government has allocated
$4 million and is working closely with the Government
and other donors to implement reforms in the timber
sector through the Liberia Forest Initiative.
It is critical that Liberia make a strong effort to
implement those needed reforms, and I am pleased
that, in the resolution adopted today, the Council has
3
S/PV.5105
underlined the need for the Government to act boldly
and quickly in instituting those reforms. Unfortunately,
Liberia’s Forestry Development Authority has not yet
implemented the reforms that have been called for.
With the full cooperation from Liberian
authorities, we believe that substantial progress can be
achieved over the next six to eight months in many of
the most important aspects of the reform effort.
In coordination with other donors, we have
outlined a critical path timeline of necessary actions
and donor resources intended to fulfil these aims and
address the principal concerns of the Council. We urge
the National Transitional Government of Liberia to do
its utmost to cooperate in this endeavour.
In closing, the United States Government is
actively engaged in assisting the Liberian authorities to
restructure both Liberia’s timber and diamond sectors
as a means to expedite, and not retard, the eventual
lifting of sanctions, once necessary and appropriate
control mechanisms have been established. It is
essential that these key resources and the revenue
derived from their export be used responsibly in the
future to improve the lives of the Liberian people and
not to perpetuate conflict, as in the past.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.
