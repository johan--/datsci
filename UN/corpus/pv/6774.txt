Agenda

The meeting was called to order at 3.40 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Guinea-Bissau
The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Guinea-Bissau to participate in this
meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2012/337, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Portugal.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Azerbaijan, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Guatemala, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal,
Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: The draft resolution received 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 2048 (2012).
I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Moraes Cabral (Portugal): Portugal welcomes
the unanimous adoption of resolution 2048 (2012). We
thank all delegations for the very active cooperation
that they lent us in order to draft it.
We see the resolution as another step forward in
the Security Council’s response to the military coup
that interrupted the democratic electoral process in
Guinea-Bissau on 12 April. The resolution imposes
targeted sanctions on the authors of the coup and those
who support that illegal act. Today, the Council has yet
again sent a strong message of condemnation and
reiterated its policy of zero-tolerance towards
unconstitutional seizures of power.
Coups d’état against legitimate democratic
authorities are simply unacceptable, as is the illegal
disruption of an electoral process that is internationally
regarded to have been free and fair. Political solutions
that exclude and exile those with the greatest
democratic electoral support while empowering
individuals who were electorally defeated are equally
unacceptable. That is a fundamental principle in any
democratic State based on the rule of law.
Portugal views the imposition of sanctions as an
instrument to exert pressure on those who reversed the
democratic process by illegally usurping power.
We are gravely concerned by increasing reports
of recurrent human rights violations by the so-called
military command, and recall that all those responsible
for such violations must be held accountable. In that
regard, we underline the Council’s measures to
consider further measures in view of the evolution of
the situation.
The resolution that we have just adopted also
stresses the importance of mediation in seeking a
solution to the crisis in Guinea-Bissau. Portugal fully
supports any mediation process that ensures an
effective and credible restoration of the constitutional
order.
The resolution also underscores the importance of
effective coordination among international partners,
namely, the African Union, the Economic Community
of West African States, the Community of Portuguese-
speaking Countries and the European Union. Such
coordination should involve the active engagement of
the United Nations. Any successful solution will require
a joint effort by all. Therefore, Portugal expects the
resolution to foster greater cohesiveness and unity of
purpose among the various efforts under way. Portugal
stands ready to actively contribute to that objective.
Mr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened
this meeting of the Security Council, which has made it
possible for us to adopt resolution 2048 (2012). I
should like to take this opportunity once again to
express to you our appreciation for the outstanding
manner in which you have led the Council’s work during
this month. Lastly, I should like to express the gratitude
of the delegation of Togo to all the members of the
Council, who spared no effort to make it possible for
Togo to join the consensus that led to the adoption of
the resolution.
S/PV.6774
312-34487
Togo joined that consensus owing to the efforts of
all members of the Council, especially those of
Portugal, to preserve the unity of the Council on an
issue of concern to the West Africa region. Nevertheless,
we were surprised to note that — barring a misreading
on our part — paragraph 2, which refers to the need for
coordination among the partners concerned in the
situation in Guinea-Bissau, did not figure in the draft
before the Council this morning. Even if that language
poses no problem for the delegation of Togo, we think
that the spirit of transparency that underpins all
negotiations should be respected in the future.
Another aspect of the draft resolution pertains to
the inclusion of the phrase “illicit drug trafficking”. In
the course of discussions, and especially those at the
experts’ level, Togo noted that the use of such language
was not appropriate to the West Africa region, even
though that phrase is acceptable when it comes to other
regions of the world. A similar position was expressed
in February when the Council negotiated and adopted
the 21 February presidential statement (S/PRST/2012/2).
The delegation of Togo would like to point out that it
agreed to the adoption of the resolution with that
language as a demonstration of flexibility. However,
we believe that, in the future, the Council should
continue to refer to drug trafficking in West Africa
without making a distinction as to whether it is licit or
illicit in nature.
Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French):
Morocco voted in favour of resolution 2048 (2012)
because it sends a strong and unanimous message from
the Council calling for the restoration of peace and
stability in Guinea-Bissau. My country also voted in
favour in the light of its constant commitment to, and
particular interest in, peace, stability and the rule of
law in the western part of our continent, with which
Morocco has long-standing relations and multifaceted
partnerships.
When the crisis in Guinea-Bissau began,
Morocco was among the first countries to condemn the
coup d’état and call for a return to the constitutional
order and for the release of those imprisoned as
political prisoners following the coup, as well as for
full respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms.
My delegation also voted for the resolution
because of the support it provides for international and
regional efforts in Guinea-Bissau. In that regard, we
especially support the sustained efforts and
commitments of the Economic Community of West
African States and other stakeholders involved in
resolving the crisis. We reiterate the need for
coordination in those mediation efforts.
In voting for the resolution, Morocco reiterates its
full readiness to support the efforts that have been
launched to ensure a return to stability. We will
continue to support such efforts, which we hope will
make it possible to reach a consensual and peaceful
political solution, in the interests of the people of
Guinea-Bissau.
Finally, I would like to acknowledge and
commend the political wisdom and sense of
compromise demonstrated by the delegations directly
concerned in order to arrive at a consensus text. That
can only strengthen the efforts of the international
community in helping to usher in a Guinea-Bissau that
is stable and at peace.
The President: There are no more names
inscribed on the list of speakers. The Security Council
has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 3.50 p.m.
