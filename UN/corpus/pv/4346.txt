The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Croatia in which she requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it was so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Ms. Ognjanovac
