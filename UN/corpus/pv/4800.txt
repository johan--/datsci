The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Georgia, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Adamia

on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
