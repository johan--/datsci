Agenda
The situation in Guinea-Bissau
Report of the Secretary-General on developments in Guinea-Bissau and the
activities of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in that country
(S/2013/26*)
2 13-24063
S/PV.6924
owing to the importance we attach to the work of
the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office
in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), the situation in
that country and the need for the political situation
to move in the right direction, namely, a return to a
constitutionally elected Government. We also did
so because we agree with extending the mandate of
UNIOGBIS for an additional three months, so as to
provide an opportunity for a new assessment of the
situation in the country and the eventual role of the
mission.
However, as my colleagues know, we had certain
difficulties with the seventh preambular paragraph of
the draft resolution. We did not want to impede the
adoption of the resolution, which, I wish to emphasize,
we support as a whole. However, we did want to set out
the reason for those difficulties, namely, that the text of
the resolution takes note of the signing of a memorandum
of understanding concerning the implementation of
the road map for the reform of the security sector in
Guinea-Bissau. That is a document we have never seen,
and we would therefore be ill-advised to take note of
a document whose contents have not been shared with
us. We point that out in the fervent hope that all the
relevant information in the Council’s resolutions will
be fully shared with all members in a timely manner.
In conclusion, I should like to point out that, since
the military coup d’état in Guinea-Bissau on 12 April
2012, Guatemala has participated actively in Security
Council discussions and has supported its resolutions
and statements. Owing to our own history, we have
adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards such breaches
of the constitutional order. We therefore supported
the Security Council’s decision to continue to actively
consider this issue. We call for the early resumption of
a democratic electoral process and for the restoration of
a legitimate Government in the country.
The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Guinea-Bissau
Report of the Secretary-General on
developments in Guinea-Bissau and the
activities of the United Nations Integrated
Peacebuilding Office in that country
(S/2013/26*)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2013/102, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Morocco, Rwanda, Togo and the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2013/26, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on developments in Guinea-Bissau
and the activities of the United Nations Integrated
Peacebuilding Office in that country.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, China, France,
Guatemala, Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan,
Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda,
Togo, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2092 (2013).
I shall now give the floor to the member of the
Council who wishes to make a statement following the
voting.
Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):
Guatemala voted in favour of resolution 2092 (2013)
