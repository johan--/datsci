Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2005/743 and
Corr.1)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus, document S/2005/743 and
corrigendum 1. Members of the Council also have
before them document S/2005/784, which contains the
text of a draft resolution. Although it was submitted by
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, I would like to confirm that, after consultation
with all members of the Council, there is now
agreement that it should be a presidential text.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it.
I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I have met with
the representatives of the parties, who have confirmed
to me that they maintain their well-known positions
vis-√†-vis the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. On the
basis of those meetings, as President, and with the
consent of the members of the Council, I have drawn
the conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision on the draft resolution (S/2005/784) before it.
If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1642 (2005).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 3.15 p.m.
