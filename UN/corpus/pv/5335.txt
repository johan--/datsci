Agenda
Post-conflict peacebuilding

S/PV.5335
The meeting was called to order at 11.30 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Post-conflict peacebuilding
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
documents S/2005/803 and S/2005/806, which contain
the texts of two draft resolutions submitted by
Denmark and the United Republic of Tanzania.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the two draft resolutions
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
two draft resolutions to the vote now, one after the
other.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall first put to the vote the draft resolution
contained in document S/2005/803.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1645 (2005).
I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution
contained in document S/2005/806.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Benin, China, Denmark, France, Greece,
Japan, Philippines, Romania, Russian Federation,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania, United
States of America.
Abstaining:
Argentina, Brazil.
The President: There were 13 votes in favour,
with two abstentions. The draft resolution has been
adopted as resolution 1646 (2005).
I shall now give the floor to those representatives
wishing to speak.
Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): Brazil firmly supports
the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission to
fill the institutional gap between action to keep peace
and the activities required to consolidate and sustain
peace. During our two-year term in the Security
Council, my delegation has consistently called
attention to the need for action in the economic and
social spheres in post-conflict situations to run parallel
to peacekeeping efforts. We remain committed to that
view.
Brazil believes that resolution 1645 (2005)
contains an imbalance in the interaction between the
Peacebuilding Commission and the main organs of the
United Nations. There can be no doubt that, in
accordance with the Charter, the primary responsibility
in questions pertaining to international peace and
security lies with the Security Council. However, when
peacebuilding activities come into play, a greater role
for the Economic and Social Council should have been
provided for in the resolution, especially given the
reformed and active Economic and Social Council we
are striving for.
In our view, the Peacebuilding Commission
should be able to determine its own agenda and to
provide recommendations and advice to any body as it
deems necessary. It must not be understood to be a
subsidiary organ of the Security Council, and it should
not operate as such.
We understand subparagraph (e) of operative
paragraph 4 to be a balancing category aimed at
correcting geographical imbalances, thereby allowing
for great representativeness and legitimacy. The
composition of the Peacebuilding Commission should
be subject to rotation, and no permanent membership
should be established.
Despite the concerns I have expressed, Brazil
voted in favour of resolution 1645 (2005), in support of
the aspirations of developing countries in post-conflict
situations. They will benefit from greater coordination
and from the availability of resources in peacebuilding
activities. We reaffirm our commitment to the
Peacebuilding Commission.

S/PV.5335
Brazil abstained in the voting on resolution 1646
(2005) because it departs from the principles agreed
upon concurrently by the General Assembly and the
Security Council in resolution 1645 (2005), on the
establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission.
Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation was very constructive throughout the entire
negotiating process on the establishment of the
Commission, which we have just approved. In that
connection, my delegation reiterates its support for the
Commission. We trust that it will be a positive body
that will be able to resolve post-conflict problems.
Nevertheless, the inclusion of members of the
Security Council in the composition of the
Peacebuilding Commission as established in resolution
1646 (2005) was something we could not support,
given that my country, Argentina, has since the
establishment of the Organization defended the
hallmark principle of the legal equality of States and
has opposed the creation of privileges.
Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My
delegation voted in favour of both resolutions because
we believe that the Peacebuilding Commission is a
necessity in the Organization and that it will play a
crucial role in assisting countries emerging from
conflict to restore peace and stability.
With regard specifically to the second resolution
adopted, 1646 (2005), my delegation voted in favour,
after much hesitation. Very simply, the text put before
us was hardly in line with the first resolution, 1645
(2005), especially as regards the representation of
members of the Security Council in the Peacebuilding
Commission.
The President: I should like to inform members
of the Council that in another place, as we would say in
the United Kingdom, a decision has been taken by
consensus: in the General Assembly. Having been
constituted by both bodies, there is now formally a
Peacebuilding Commission.
Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): Benin
voted in favour of resolution 1645 (2005), on the
Peacebuilding Commission. We did so because we
support that body and that resolution in both spirit and
letter.
However, we deem it inappropriate for the
resolution to have been submitted under the current
agenda item title. My delegation believes that the
peacebuilding commission is designed both to prevent
conflicts and to address post-conflict issues. We
therefore feel that the title of this agenda item may
prejudice the implementation of paragraph 12 (c) of the
resolution.
Mr. Brencick (United States of America): I just
want to note that we will be circulating an explanation
of our vote as a document of the Council.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on the agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.
