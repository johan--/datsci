The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of the
Central African Republic in which he requests to be invited
to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council’s

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Deinde

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
