The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2002/1243, containing the report of the

document S/2002/1277, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the Council’s prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Security Council, I have
met the representatives of the parties, who have
confirmed to me that they maintain their well known
positions vis-à-vis the item on the Council’s agenda.
On the basis of those meetings, as President, with the
consent of the members of the Council, I have drawn
the conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision on the draft resolution before it.
If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Colombia, France,
Guinea, Ireland, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway,

The President (spoke in Chinese): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1442 (2002).

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
