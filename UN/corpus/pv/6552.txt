Agenda
Non-proliferation
S/PV.6552
11-368842
The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Non-proliferation
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/348, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Germany, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and United States of America
Abstaining:
Lebanon
The President (spoke in French): There were 14
votes in favour, none against and one abstention. The
draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 1984
(2011).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): Lebanon
reaffirms that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons is based on balance between the
three pillars of disarmament, non-proliferation and the
right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. For
Lebanon and all Arab countries, that balance is the
principal avenue for meeting the aspirations of their
peoples to a world free of nuclear weapons. As we seek
to create such a world, we await the day when the
peoples of the Middle East will be able to live in a
region free of nuclear weapons similar to other such
regions around the world.
Despite our awareness that the resolution we have
just adopted is purely technical in nature and that many
delegations have striven to keep it so, and because
Lebanon abstained in the voting on resolution 1929
(2010) — whereby, pursuant to its paragraph 29, the
Panel of Experts was established — Lebanon, in line
with its consistent position, abstained again today in
the voting.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): Russia voted in favour of resolution 1984
(2011), which extends the mandate of the Panel of
Experts of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006) on sanctions against Iran.
The Panel is an important component of the
Iranian sanctions regime and does useful and practical
work in assisting the 1737 Committee. It collects and
verifies facts about possible violations of sanctions,
carries out analyses and prepares recommendations and
assessments. The results of the Panel of Experts’ work
are reflected in its reports.
In that connection, it is most important for the
Panel to comply strictly with its mandate, act
impartially and independently, and use reliable sources
of information when preparing its conclusions and
recommendations. Unverified or politicized
information does not help to promote any initiative of
the Security Council or its committees. We note the
importance of the experts exercising sensible caution
with respect to the information they receive.
The goal of the procedure provided for in the
resolution adopted today — whereby the Panel of
Experts shall provide the 1737 Committee with a
preliminary programme of work, with subsequent
regular discussions between the Committee and the
Panel — is to further enhance the effectiveness of the
efforts of that monitoring mechanism. We believe that
these efforts can help to ensure useful leadership by the
Committee of the Panel’s work.
The resolution also stipulates that midterm and
final reports of the Panel shall first be provided to the
Committee, where members of the Security Council
will be able to hold preliminary discussions of the
documents with the experts. Such interactive
cooperation between States members of the Council
with the Panel will enable the detailed consideration of
the Panel’s conclusions and recommendations and
allow the members to receive, if necessary, more
specific information or explanations from the experts
on various provisions of the reports and to take into
account the national views that have been expressed.
S/PV.6552
311-36884
It is clear that, following such discussions, the
reports submitted by the Panel to the Council will raise
fewer questions among members of the Security
Council, be more useful and enable the Council to
develop an agreed position on the recommendations of
the experts.
The Russian Federation will continue to
cooperate fully with the Panel of Experts of the 1737
Committee.
Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China voted in favour of resolution 1984 (2011), which
extends the mandate of the Panel of Experts of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006). As a component of the Council’s Iranian
sanctions regime, the Panel shall work in strict
accordance with the mandate established by resolution
1929 (2010) under the direction of the Committee and
the principles of impartiality, objectivity and
independence.
The resolution just adopted further emphasizes
those principles and requirements, as well as the
importance of credible, fact-based, independent
assessments, analysis and recommendations, in
accordance with the Panel of Experts’ mandate. It
requests the Panel to provide to the Committee a
planned programme of work and to heed the opinions
of the Committee concerning the midterm and final
reports it provides to the Council, in an effort to
enhance its communications with the Committee.
China hopes that the Panel will adhere strictly to
these principles and requirements and play its due role
in promoting the comprehensive and effective
implementation of the relevant resolutions of the
Council.
Mrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): The
United States welcomes the renewal of the Iran Panel
of Experts’ mandate today. United Nations sanctions
panels are a well-established independent tool for
improving the implementation of United Nations
sanctions. They play a critical role in enhancing the
credibility of Security Council resolutions. The Iran
Panel is further evidence of this and deserves our full
support. The Panel has conducted excellent
investigative work. We welcome the Panel’s
professionalism and high standards.
The latest report of the Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
underscores Iran’s continued failure to comply with its
international nuclear obligations and its sustained lack
of full cooperation with the IAEA. It further
demonstrates that Iran has not taken any meaningful
steps required of it by this Council or called for by the
IAEA Board of Governors.
In the light of Iran’s ongoing non-compliance,
most notably Iran’s expanded uranium enrichment, it is
imperative that the international community strengthen
the enforcement of these sanctions. The Panel of
Experts offers the Council and its Iran Sanction’s
Committee seasoned advice on how to do that. The full
implementation of the provisions contained in the
Council’s resolutions will send a powerful signal to
Iran’s decision makers, as well as constrain Iran’s
ability to continue its proliferation-sensitive activities.
Today’s vote, combined with the joint statement
issued today by China, France, Germany, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States
at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna,
serves to reinforce the unity shared among these
countries to resolve our shared concerns about Iran’s
nuclear programme.
Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): I
welcome the adoption of resolution 1984 (2011), which
France, Germany and the United States co-sponsored.
The measures adopted by the Security Council
are aimed at convincing Iran to negotiate and slow the
development of its nuclear and ballistic programme. In
order to be effective, they must therefore be fully
implemented by all States.
The independent Panel of Experts established last
year by resolution 1929 (2010) plays a crucial role in
ensuring that the measures adopted by the Council are
implemented, but also that they continue to be effective
and are not violated. The Panel has done outstanding
work in just a few months. It has carried out essential
awareness-raising work with many Member States to
explain the measures adopted by the Council. It has
provided valuable analyses and recommendations
geared towards understanding and improving the
implementation of sanctions. I would like to express
our gratitude to all the experts for their
professionalism.
However, their task is not yet complete — far
from it. Iran continues to violate its international
obligations, as illustrated by instances of violations
S/PV.6552
11-368844
reported to the Sanctions Committee and by the latest
report of the Director General of the International
Atomic Energy Agency. Much therefore remains to be
done. The international community must continue to
mobilize in order to strengthen the implementation of
the sanctions adopted by the Council.
We therefore welcome the renewal of the
mandate of the Panel of Experts for another year. This
is yet another signal to Iran from the international
community about its determination to secure full
respect for the Council’s resolutions. Moreover, we
await the speedy publication of the Panel’s final report
as an official document of the Security Council, in line
with the usual practice of sanctions committees.
Transparency is crucial in order for all members to be
informed and for improving the implementation of
sanctions. Lastly, we hope that the Committee will
carry out an in-depth discussion of the Panel’s final
report, with a view to determining how to follow up the
Panel’s recommendations.
Mr. Berger (Germany): By adopting resolution
1929 (2010), one year ago, the Security Council sent
out a strong signal of determination to resolve the
Iranian nuclear file. One important element of that
resolution was the establishment of the Panel of
Experts. Germany is of the view that the dual-track
strategy can only produce results if the existing
measures agreed by the Council are thoroughly
implemented.
The Panel of Experts has contributed
significantly to improving the implementation of
existing measures. Germany acknowledges the
professionalism and dedication of the eight experts. We
would like to seize this opportunity to express our
appreciation to the experts in the light of their
continued efforts to offer advice to the Council and the
Iran Sanctions Committee.
We therefore welcome the renewal of the
mandate of the Panel of Experts for 12 months.
Together with France, the United Kingdom and the
United States, we supported this resolution as a
co-sponsor. Germany is convinced that the Panel has
achieved important tasks. We area also of the view
that, as adopted, the text ensures the crucial
independence of the Panel. We would like to see the
Panel continue its work with the same degree of
professionalism as in the past.
Let me conclude by highlighting that, together
with our partners in the international community, we
remain committed to finding a long-lasting and
peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear file.
Mr. Quarrey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the adoption today of resolution
1984 (2011), which extends the work of the Panel of
Experts to support the work of the Iran Sanctions
Committee.
The latest report of the Panel shows that Iran
continues to violate the sanctions imposed on it by the
Council, as illustrated again this week by Iran’s claim
to be increasing 20-per-cent-uranium enrichment. The
full implementation of the sanctions is crucial to
preventing Iran from further developing its illicit
nuclear programmes, and in sending a clear signal to
the Iranian regime that its actions aimed at
undermining international peace and security will not
be tolerated.
We believe that the Panel plays a critical role in
ensuring the full implementation of the Council’s
sanctions on Iran. Just as Iran adapts to evade those
sanctions, so must the Council adapt to ensure that the
sanctions remain effective. The Panel’s
recommendations and its advice to the Council are an
essential part of that.
As we said when we last me on this issue, the
Panel’s final report must be made public. The Council
and the wider United Nations membership need the
Panel’s advice to guide them in better enforcing the
sanctions.
The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council
will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 3.30 p.m.
