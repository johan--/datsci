I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan): I should like to briefly
share with the Council the reasoning behind our vote on
resolution 2058 (2012).
Azerbaijan believes that achieving a mutually
acceptable and comprehensive settlement of the
Cyprus problem within the established United Nations
parameters is possible and within reach. Therefore,
I would like to reiterate our full support for the
Secretary-General’s efforts to that end. It is clear
that the settlement can be attained only through a
results-oriented process and continued support to the
Secretary-General’s good offices mission.
In our view, the resolution just adopted is
inconsistent with the Secretary-General’s assessment
contained in paragraphs 4 and 43 of his report in
document S/2012/507. Thus, the Secretary-General is
of the view, inter alia, that
“a stage in the negotiation process has once again
been reached where it is incumbent on the sides to
agree to and proceed with a way forward for the
talks” (S/2012/507, para. 43).
In fact, the resolution does not place the required
emphasis on the necessity to agree on a results-oriented
process. Unfortunately, our proposed amendments
in that regard, which were supported by some other
Council members, were not heeded. Furthermore, our
proposal — again supported by some other Council
members — to ensure that the language of the preamble
reflected a sense of encouragement of the review, which
we believe is essential to ensuring that the mandate of the
United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus operates
in accordance with the developments and realities on
the ground, was not given due consideration. As a
result, according to our understanding, the resolution
just adopted significantly reduces the importance of
such a review.
For the reasons I have just cited, Azerbaijan decided
to abstain in the voting on resolution 2058 (2012).
Mr. Tarar (Pakistan): My delegation would like
to express its disappointment and dissatisfaction at the
way the Council has proceeded with resolution 2058
(2012). From the point of view of both procedure and
substance, the Council could have done better. We
would like to note that not enough time was given to
all Council members to engage in open and transparent
The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2012/507)
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2012/555, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2012/507, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations operation in
Cyprus.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
IshouldliketoinformtheCouncilthatthepresidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of the
parties, who have confirmed that they maintain their
well-known positions vis-à-vis the item on the Council’s
agenda. On the basis of those meetings, with the
consent of the members of the Council, the presidency
has drawn the conclusion that the Council can proceed
to take a decision on the draft resolution before it. If I
hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Colombia, China, France, Germany, Guatemala,
India, Morocco, Portugal, Russian Federation, South
Africa, Togo, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America
Abstentions:
Azerbaijan, Pakistan
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 13
votes in favour, none against and two abstentions. The
draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 2058
(2012).
12-42626 3
S/PV.6809
In view of all this, it was not possible for my
delegation to join the consensus.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
more names on the list of speakers.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
negotiations that could have achieved the desired
consensus on the text. The views of all members have,
unfortunately, not been taken on board, and the text
is also not fully reflective of the recommendations of
the Secretary-General. It was also important to fairly
reflect the views of the parties in the text.
