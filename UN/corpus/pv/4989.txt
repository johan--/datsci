The meeting was called to order at 12.50 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2004/427)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus, contained in document
S/2004/427.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2004/484, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I have met with
the representatives of the parties, who have confirmed
to me that they maintain their well-known positions
vis-à-vis the item on the Council’s agenda. On the
basis of those meetings, as President, with the consent
of the members of the Council, I have drawn the
conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear
any objection, I shall now put the draft resolution to
the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1548 (2004).
I shall now give the floor to those members who
wish to make statements following the voting.
Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom welcomes the unanimous adoption of
this resolution to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). It
is undeniable that the situation in Cyprus has evolved,
not only since the referenda of 24 April but also over
the 40 years that this operation has been on the island.
We therefore support the Secretary-General’s decision
to conduct a comprehensive review of UNFICYP’s role
and to make recommendations in that regard. We look
forward to early consideration of those
recommendations by the Security Council with a view
to tailoring UNFICYP to reflect current requirements.
The successful conclusion of the Council’s
deliberations on UNFICYP today will now allow the
Council to turn its attention to consideration of the
Secretary-General’s report on his mission of good
offices in Cyprus (S/2004/437), which the United
Kingdom has welcomed.
Mr. Cunningham (United States of America):
Recent significant developments in Cyprus, including
the results of the referenda on the Secretary-General’s
peace plan and the entry of Cyprus into the European
Union, have fundamentally changed the situation in
Cyprus and necessitate a critical examination of the
United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) and of the need for the UNFICYP mission.
We welcome the Secretary-General’s commitment to
provide recommendations on UNFICYP’s mandate,
size and concept of operations within three months. We
also look forward to recommendations regarding future
funding of UNFICYP.
The United States voted in favour of this
resolution because it articulates a timeline by which the
Council will act upon those recommendations. It
should be clear that the appropriate action for the
Council will be to adopt a new mandate for UNFICYP
in the light of the Secretary-General’s
recommendations. Resources for peacekeeping
operations are under strain, as the demand for United
Nations peacekeeping has risen significantly in recent
years. The Council must be willing to review ongoing
peacekeeping operations to make changes as required
by new circumstances in order to be a responsible
steward of peacekeeping resources and to sustain
support for new peacekeeping operations.

S/PV.4989
This resolution also addresses remaining
restrictions on UNFICYP’s operations by Turkish and
Turkish Cypriot forces. We regret that, owing to the
results of the referenda — specifically, the Greek
Cypriot rejection of the United Nations plan — the
territorial transfer envisioned to occur under the plan
has not been realized. That would have resulted in the
peaceful transfer of areas in which UNFICYP has dealt
with, and must continue to deal with, violations of the
military status quo, such as in Strovilia.
I would also like to take this opportunity to say a
few words regarding the Secretary-General’s report on
his mission of good offices in Cyprus (S/2004/437).
We regret the results of the 24 April referenda on the
United Nations settlement plan, which represent a
missed historic opportunity for peace. We deeply
appreciate the even-handed work of the Secretary-
General and of his Special Adviser, Alvaro de Soto, in
the search for peace on Cyprus, and we welcome and
support the Secretary-General’s objective, balanced
and accurate report.
We wholeheartedly support the conclusions and
recommendations contained in that report. We agree
with the report’s conclusion that the rejection of the
Secretary-General’s settlement plan by the Greek
Cypriot electorate raises fundamental questions
regarding their commitment to a bizonal, bicommunal
federal solution of the Cyprus problem. We support
both the report’s suggestion that Greek Cypriots may
wish to reflect on that matter and the conclusion that, if
they remain committed to such a solution, that needs to
be demonstrated not just by words, but by action.
We agree with the report that the way ahead to a
settlement is for the Greek Cypriots to articulate, with
clarity and finality, concerns that they have indicated
regarding implementation of the settlement plan and its
security provisions. Only when they have been
articulated can such concerns be addressed by the
Secretary-General and by the Security Council, where
we stand willing to play a constructive role.
We support the report’s assessment that Turkey
and the Turkish Cypriots have done everything
possible to reach a Cyprus settlement. We share the
Secretary-General’s appreciation for the efforts of
Turkish Cypriot community leader Talat, both in the
talks and in the run-up to the referenda. As the report
says, the Turkish Government gave strong support to
the Secretary-General’s efforts to reach a solution.
Prime Minister Erdoğan kept his commitment to be one
step ahead in the efforts for a solution, and in fact it
was the change of policy engineered by the
Government of Turkey that made this year’s peace
effort possible.
With the Secretary-General, we appreciate
Greece’s support for his efforts, including specifically
for his final settlement plan as well.
As the report states, Turkish Cypriots have, with
their “yes” vote on 24 April, clearly and convincingly
come out in favour of the reunification of Cyprus in a
bicommunal, bizonal federation. We support the
Secretary-General’s recommendation in paragraph 93
of the report that members of the Security Council
should encourage the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey to
remain committed to the goal of reunification. We
agree that, to that end — and not for the purpose of
affording recognition or assisting secession — the
Security Council should give a strong lead to all States
to cooperate, both bilaterally and in international
bodies, to eliminate unnecessary restrictions and
barriers that have the effect of isolating Turkish
Cypriots and impeding their development. We concur
with the Secretary-General’s assessment that such a
move is consistent with Security Council resolutions
541 (1983) and 550 (1984).
We look forward to strong Security Council
action in support of the Secretary-General and the
recommendations contained in his report.
Mr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish):
Following the Secretary-General’s recommendation,
we voted in favour of a six-month extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP). We await with interest the results
of the announced review of UNFICYP’s mandate to be
carried out by the Secretary-General.
Finally, we call upon the parties to maintain their
commitment to the objective of reunification. We
believe that any measure that facilitates reunification
deserves our support. From that perspective, we
consider it valid to adopt measures to narrow the
development gap between the parties. Such measures
must conform to the provisions of Security Council
resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984), and, as the
Secretary-General indicates in his report (S/2004/437),
they must not have the objective of recognizing
another State on Cyprus or of facilitating secession.

S/PV.4989
Mr. Akram (Pakistan): Pakistan voted in favour
of resolution 1548 (2004), which authorizes an
extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for six
months. However, we supported the resolution with
serious reservations.
This resolution was supposed to be a proposal for
a technical extension of UNFICYP for a short period of
time that would enable the Secretary-General and the
Security Council to undertake a review of its mandate,
force size and concept of operations in the light of the
new circumstances. That is natural following the recent
rejection of the Secretary-General’s compromise plan
for a comprehensive Cyprus settlement and bearing in
mind the positions of the concerned parties. Thus, in
our view, UNFICYP’s mandate should have been
extended for only three months to enable that review to
take place, rather than for the six months endorsed in
the resolution.
Moreover, the inclusion of operative paragraph 3
in the resolution changed it from a procedural to a
substantive proposition. The reference in this
paragraph could have been balanced by inclusion of
language that was suggested by another delegation in
our informal consultations. The resolution also should
have incorporated a reference to the report of the
Secretary-General on his good-offices mission, which
was introduced by his Special Adviser, Mr. Alvaro de
Soto, on 8 June.
In April this year, after decades of hostility on the
island, the referendums on the Secretary-General’s plan
for the reunification of Cyprus offered the hope for a
permanent settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Unfortunately, the plan was rejected by the Greek
Cypriot side, while it was accepted by the Turkish
Cypriot side.
The Secretary-General considers it a historic
opportunity that has been missed. That view is widely
shared by the international community. The Secretary-
General believes that the rejection of his plan is a
major setback which will cast a dark shadow of
uncertainty over the implementation of a number of
issues so dear to the hearts of so many Cypriots,
including the question of the reunification of the
island.
In paragraph 83 of the report on his good-offices
mission, the Secretary-General states:
“Benefits for the Greek Cypriots, which have
been sought for decades — including the
reunification of Cyprus, the return of a large
swathe of territory, the return of most displaced
persons to their homes … the withdrawal of all
troops not permitted by international treaties …
have been forgone. The result is the maintenance
of the status quo — a status quo deemed
unacceptable by the Security Council.”
In paragraph 93 of the report, the Secretary-
General said:
“I would hope they [the members of the Council]
can give a strong lead to all States to cooperate
both bilaterally and in international bodies to
eliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers
that have the effect of isolating the Turkish
Cypriots and impeding their development,
deeming such a move as consistent with Security
Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984).”
The Security Council will, we hope, soon endorse
this recommendation of the Secretary-General and urge
actions by the international community to take concrete
steps to end the economic isolation of the Turkish
Cypriot community, which has been penalized for so
many years and is now unable to enjoy the benefits of
European Union membership accorded to their Greek
Cypriot compatriots.
In the circumstances, and pending the Council’s
decision on the Secretary-General’s good-offices
report, the Security Council should have taken a
position that was more even-handed in the resolution
we adopted today. A provision to welcome the
Secretary-General’s good-offices report would have
been one way to indicate such even-handedness.
Unfortunately, even this suggestion was not
accommodated in the text.
We can only hope that the resolution we have just
adopted will not prove to be counterproductive and that
it will not generate a further sense of injustice among
the Turkish Cypriot community. The Security Council
should act to strengthen the hand of the Secretary-
General in any future move to implement his plan and
help to bring us closer to the resolution of the Cyprus
issue on the basis of a bicommunal, bizonal federation
reflecting the wishes and interests of both the Greek
and the Turkish Cypriot communities.

S/PV.4989
Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My
delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution on the
question of Cyprus because it is a response to the
request made by the Government of Cyprus that the
United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) be
maintained on the island beyond 15 June 2004.
My delegation would have preferred that, as was
agreed beforehand, the draft resolution be a purely
technical text. Clearly, that is not quite the case, as has
just been noted by my colleague from Pakistan.
My delegation hopes that the Security Council
will consider the report of the Secretary-General on his
mission of good offices, including the
recommendations contained therein.
Mr. Motoc (Romania): My delegation voted in
favour of the resolution, since, as recommended by the
Secretary-General’s report on the United Nations Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP), after consultations with both
sides and the guarantor powers, and in the absence of a
comprehensive settlement, the presence of UNFICYP
on the island continues to be necessary.
We welcome the intention of the Secretary-
General to conduct a review of UNFICYP’s mandate,
force levels and concept of operations. We believe that,
in the current conditions, a comprehensive review of
the scope of the United Nations Mission in Cyprus is
required.
UNFICYP’s review is an inextricable part of the
way forward for Cyprus, as also noted in the Secretary-
General’s report on his mission of good offices. As a
country of the region, Romania considers that efforts
aimed at the reunification of Cyprus should continue.
During the past month, there have been considerable
advances towards a much better perspective for a
solution to this longstanding problem. As stated in
paragraph 81 of the report, “A new fluidity has
developed in the interaction of the players.” There have
also been encouraging positive developments between
Greece and Turkey; and probably the most important is
the message sent by the Turkish Cypriots in favour of
reunification.
All these elements can gradually improve the
situation on the ground and create conditions
conducive to renewed efforts. The responsibility for
the continuation of efforts lies primarily with the
leadership of the two communities. We need strong
leadership and goodwill from all parties, as well as a
sustained focus on the part of the international
community, in order to reach a feasible solution to this
longstanding issue.
The European Union played a major role in the
recent attempt to end the division in the island. We
hope that the European Union will continue to be the
same driving force in the pursuit of the goal of the
reunification of Cyprus.
Regarding the recommendations included in the
good-offices report, we will support further action by
the Council to encourage positive steps forward for
Cyprus as well as any measure by the European Union
or other international players aimed at promoting
reunification and goodwill on the island. An incentive
in that respect could be the removal of unnecessary
restrictions and barriers for the Turkish Cypriot
community, with due regard for resolutions 541 (1983)
and 550 (1984).
We would nonetheless like to caution against any
rash steps that could upset the delicate balance in
Cyprus.
The President: There are no further speakers on
my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.
