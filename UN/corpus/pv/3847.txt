The meeting was called to order at 11.20 a.m.
Expression of welcome to the new members of the
Security Council and of thanks to the outgoing members
of the Security Council
The President (interpretation from French): As this
is the first meeting of the Security Council to be held this
year, I should like to wish a happy new year to all the
members of the Security Council, as well as to all Members
of the United Nations and to the Secretariat and, in
particular, to welcome the new members of the Council:
Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, the Gambia and Slovenia. We all
look forward with confidence to their participation in the
work of the Council, and we are convinced that their
experience and wisdom will be of invaluable assistance in
the discharge of the Council’s responsibilities.
I should like also to express the Council’s gratitude to
the outgoing members for their active and decisive
contributions to the Council’s work. The representatives of
Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the Republic of
Korea well deserve it. For two years they all contributed
decisively to the conduct of the business of the Council.
Expression of thanks to the retiring President
The President (interpretation from French): I should
like also to pay tribute to my predecessor, Ambassador
Berrocal Soto of Costa Rica, for the service he rendered as
President of the Council during the month of December
1997. I express my deep appreciation to him on behalf of
the members of the Council for the great skill he
demonstrated as President, and I should also like to thank
him for having called on us to participate in a meeting
presided over by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Costa
Rica.
Adoption of the agenda

The situation in Croatia

like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Croatia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional
rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

prepared in the course of the Council’s prior

from the Chargé d’affaires ad interim of the Permanent
Mission of Yugoslavia to the United Nations addressed to
