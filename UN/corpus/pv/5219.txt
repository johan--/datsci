Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Sierra Leone
Twenty-fifth report of the Secretary-General on
the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone
(S/2005/273 and Add.1)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Sierra Leone in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the consideration of the
item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the consideration, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Pemagbi
(Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
twenty-fifth report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, documents
S/2005/273 and Addendum 1.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2005/418, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
I wish to draw the attention of members to
photocopies of a letter dated 29 June 2005 from the
representative of Sierra Leone addressed to the
President of the Security Council, which will be issued
as document S/2005/419.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by a show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1610 (2005).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
