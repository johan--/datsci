take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of the
Council, to Ambassador John Sawers, Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland to the United Nations, for his
service as President of the Security Council for the
month of 2008. I am sure I speak for all members of
the Council in expressing deep appreciation to
Ambassador Sawers for the diplomatic skill with which
he conducted the Council’s business last month.

The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Letter dated 16 May 2008 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the
Security Council (S/2008/334)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Lebanon, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Salam
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them

draft resolution submitted by France.
Members of the Council also have before them

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2008/210, which contains a letter dated
28 March 2008 from the Secretary-General transmitting
the tenth report of the International Independent
Investigation Commission.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
