The meeting was called to order at 7.05 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
The President: I should like to acknowledge the
presence at the Council table of the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Denmark, His Excellency Mr. Per
Stig Moeller; the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
France, His Excellency Mr. Philippe Douste-Blazy; the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, Her Excellency
Mrs. Dora Bakoyannis; the First Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Qatar, His
Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr Al-
Thani; the Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Her Excellency
Mrs. Margaret Beckett, M.P.; and the Secretary of State
of the United States of America, Her Excellency
Ms. Condoleezza Rice.
On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to all of them.
I should like to inform the Council that I have
received letters from the representatives of Israel and
Lebanon, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Gillerman
(Israel) and Mr. Mitri (Lebanon) took seats at the
Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/640, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Denmark, France, Ghana,
Greece, Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
I wish to draw the attention of the members to
documents S/2006/571, S/2006/578, S/2006/599,
S/2006/621, S/2006/625, S/2006/630 and S/2006/639,
containing the text of letters dated 24, 26 and 31 July,
and 4, 7, 9 and 11 August 2006, respectively, from
Lebanon addressed to the President of the Security
Council.
I also wish to draw the attention of members of
the Council to documents S/2006/595 and S/2006/626,
containing the text of letters dated 29 July and
7 August 2006 from the Secretary-General addressed to
the President of the Security Council, as well as
document S/2006/593, containing the note by the
Secretary-General dated 28 July 2006.
I give the floor to the Secretary-General.
The Secretary-General: I welcome wholeheartedly
the draft resolution the Council is about to adopt and I
am greatly relieved that it provides for a full and
immediate cessation of hostilities. It is absolutely vital
that the fighting now stop. Provided it does, I believe
that this draft resolution will make it possible to
conclude a sustainable and lasting ceasefire agreement
in the days ahead, and I hope that this could be the
beginning of a process to solve the underlying political
problems in the region through peaceful means.
But I would be remiss if I did not tell members
how profoundly disappointed I am that the Council did
not reach this point much, much earlier, and I am
convinced that my disappointment and sense of
frustration are shared by hundreds of millions of
people around the world. For weeks now, I and many
others have been calling repeatedly for an immediate
cessation of hostilities, for the sake of the civilian
population on both sides who have suffered such
terrible, unnecessary pain and loss. All members of the
Council must be aware that this inability to act sooner
has badly shaken the world‚Äôs faith in its authority and
integrity.
Since 12 July, when Hizbollah launched an
unprovoked attack on Israel, killing eight Israeli
soldiers and kidnapping two, both Lebanon and Israel
have been thrown back into the turmoil of war, death
and destruction.
According to the Lebanese Government, over
1,000 Lebanese have been killed and over 3,600
injured. Around a quarter of all of Lebanon‚Äôs
inhabitants, close to a million people, have been
displaced. Too many of the victims have been children.
In fact, more children than fighters have died in this
S/PV.5511
306-46491
conflict. Israeli bombing has turned thousands of
homes to rubble. It has also destroyed dozens of
bridges and roads, with the result that more than
100,000 people cannot reach safety; nor can relief
supplies reach them. Such devastation would be tragic
at any time. That it has been inflicted on Lebanon‚Äôs
people just when they were beginning to make real
progress towards political reform and economic
recovery makes it all the more so.
Israelis, for their part, have been newly awakened
to a threat which they had hoped, with good reason, to
have escaped when ‚Äî as the Council certified on my
recommendation ‚Äî they withdrew from Lebanon six
years ago. Some 41 Israeli civilians have been killed,
and hundreds of thousands have had their lives
disrupted ‚Äî being forced into shelters or to flee their
homes ‚Äî by rocket attacks from Hizbollah, which has
launched its fire indiscriminately, to sow the widest
possible terror, making no effort to distinguish between
civilian and military targets and also endangering
civilians on its own side by firing from the midst of
heavily populated areas.
Nor has the damage been limited to Lebanon and
Israel. A region that could ill afford another chapter of
violence and another source of instability has been
inflamed further still. Extremists have been given new
ammunition. The United Nations itself has been a target
of protest and violence, despite the Organization‚Äôs
humanitarian efforts, including those of our valiant
peacekeepers in the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL), to reach people trapped in the
crossfire. UNIFIL has had to cope with a situation for
which it was neither mandated nor equipped.
I am full of pride and admiration for the
courageous men and women who serve under the
United Nations flag, and indeed for all the
humanitarian workers; they have shown incredible
courage since 12 July in carrying out their duties in the
midst of intense fighting, which has injured 16 United
Nations personnel and, tragically, caused the deaths of
five others.
Indeed, UNIFIL‚Äôs tenacity has made possible the
diplomatic solution that you, the members of the Security
Council, have just forged. Without it, you would have
had to face the difficult prospect of UNIFIL‚Äôs
withdrawal. Indeed, you may yet have to face it in the
hours and days ahead if the immediate cessation of
hostilities called for in the draft resolution does not hold.
So, this draft resolution comes none too soon, and
it marks a vital step forward. I am glad that Council
members have been able to resolve their differences,
accommodating many points of view, and I hope they
will adopt this text unanimously. Having done so, they
must work with equal determination to make what they
have agreed fully effective on the ground.
First of all, humanitarian convoys and relief
workers must be given a real guarantee of safe passage
and access to those who need help. As soon as the
fighting stops, the daunting challenge of helping
people to return to their homes safely and rebuild their
lives begins.
Secondly, the draft resolution rightly has at its
core Lebanon‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity,
consistent with Council resolutions 425 (1978), 1559
(2004) and 1680 (2006). The international community
must give the Lebanese Government all possible
support, so that it can make that sovereignty effective.
The Government, acting through its regular armed
forces and police, must be able to assert its authority
throughout the country and on all its borders,
particularly to prevent illegal and destabilizing flows
of arms. Only when there is one authority, and one gun,
will there be a chance of lasting stability. The Lebanese
State, like any other sovereign State, must have a
monopoly of the use of force on its own territory.
That implies, of course, a full and swift Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanese territory. We now have a
clear scenario for achieving that.
The decision of the Lebanese Government to
deploy 15,000 of the country‚Äôs armed forces to the
south is a significant development. But, ready and
willing as the army may be to undertake this task, the
Government itself has acknowledged the need for help.
This makes the Council‚Äôs decision to strengthen the
mandate and the numbers of UNIFIL a vital ingredient
of the package.
Now, UNIFIL faces a new task, perhaps even
more difficult and dangerous than its previous one. It
must be robust and effective and ensure that no vacuum
is left between the Israeli withdrawal and the
deployment of Lebanese forces. Obviously, if it is to
carry out this new mandate, it needs to be augmented
with the utmost urgency and provided with
sophisticated military capabilities. The Council cannot
afford to relax for one minute. I urge its members to
consult closely, and at once, with both existing and
S/PV.5511
06-464914
potential troop contributors, with a view to generating
the additional forces needed as quickly as possible,
before the situation on the ground once again spins out
of control. And I urge the Council to make sure they
have the equipment they will need.
I also appeal to all potential donors to respond
swiftly to requests from the Lebanese Government for
financial help as it struggles to reconstruct its
devastated country.
Some may well be reluctant to do so without
solid assurances that, this time, peace is here to stay.
Such assurances are indeed essential. And they must
rest not only on the cessation of hostilities or the
deployment of an expanded peace force, but on the
resolution of fundamental underlying political
problems, including the release of prisoners, starting
with those who have been taken hostage, and a
resolution of the Sheba‚Äôa farms issue in accordance
with resolution 1680 (2006).
I will therefore lose no time in taking up the role
assigned to me in today‚Äôs draft resolution. We have just
had a terrible lesson in the dangers of allowing
problems to fester. We must by now all know that,
unless we address unfinished business, it can and will
take us unawares.
The Lebanese Government will meet tomorrow,
and the Israeli Cabinet on Sunday, to review the
resolution. Over the weekend, I will undertake to
establish, with both parties, the exact date and time at
which the cessation hostilities will come into effect.
Lebanon has been a victim for too long. Mired in
an incomplete political transformation since the end of
the civil war, it has remained an arena in which both
domestic and regional actors could play out their self-
interested schemes. Such exploitation of a vulnerable
country is shameful. It has undermined the laudable
efforts of many Lebanese citizens to consolidate their
country as a sovereign, independent and democratic State.
The country and its people deserve better. They
deserve the full support of the United Nations in their
effort to cast off the chains of external interference and
domestic strife. Doing so will require both the
establishment of national consensus among Lebanese
and constructive cooperation, based on mutual
goodwill and sustained dialogue, by all relevant parties
and actors at the regional level, including the
Governments of Syria and Iran.
Indeed, over the past five weeks we have been
reminded yet again what a fragile, tense, crisis-ridden
region the Middle East has become ‚Äî probably now
more complex and difficult than ever before. It is now
undergoing changes, shifts and realignments on a scale,
and of a strategic significance, not seen since the
colonial Powers withdrew at the end of the Second
World War. Perhaps even more ominous than the
physical destruction are the changes in perception that
have been occurring, both inside the region and beyond
it. The Middle East, which has long figured at the very
top of the Council‚Äôs agenda, is likely to remain there
for years to come.
The draft resolution that the Council is about to
adopt is only one step towards the comprehensive
approach that is needed. Other steps will need to be
taken ‚Äî many others. In order to prevent yet another
eruption of violence and bloodshed, the international
community must now be prepared to offer sustained
support and assistance for the political and economic
reconstruction of Lebanon, and also to address the
broader context of crisis in the region.
In particular, we must not turn our backs on the
bloodshed, suffering and hardship that have continued
to afflict Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the West
Bank, or the danger from Qassam rockets that
continues to threaten the Israeli communities bordering
the Gaza Strip. Progress in the Middle East peace
process would undoubtedly facilitate the resolution of
conflicts elsewhere in the region, and vice versa.
Therefore, the various crises in the region must
henceforth be addressed not in isolation or bilaterally,
but as part of a holistic and comprehensive effort,
sanctioned and championed by the Council, to bring
peace and stability to the region as a whole.
The parallel crises in Lebanon and Gaza over the
past few weeks have demonstrated, once again, that
there are no military solutions to this conflict. War is
not ‚Äî I repeat, war is not ‚Äî the continuation of
politics by other means. On the contrary, it represents a
catastrophic failure of political skill and imagination
‚Äî a dethronement of peaceful politics from the
primacy which it should enjoy. By taking the first step
today towards ending the fighting in Lebanon, the
Council is belatedly reasserting that primacy ‚Äî as the
founders of this Organization expected it to do.
Only political solutions will be sustainable in the
long term. The peace treaties between Israel and Egypt,
S/PV.5511
506-46491
and between Israel and Jordan, are expressions of
stable political arrangements and agreements. Through
these treaties, the leaders of the countries concerned
have courageously brought stability and peace to
borders that were previously beset with violence, and
thus to their peoples. Ultimately, similar arrangements,
based on foundations that are well known to all of us,
will have to be put in place along all the borders where
there is conflict. Only comprehensive solutions can
bring lasting peace.
The United Nations stands for a just solution to
all these issues. We stand for security for Lebanon, for
Israel and for the region. We stand for a comprehensive
solution, and must therefore do our utmost to address
all the separate but intertwined issues and conflicts in
the region, whether manifest or latent. Delays will only
mean more lost lives, more shattered hopes and a
further decline in the standing and authority of the
Council and the Organization.
We must spare the people of Lebanon, of Israel
and of the wider region any further bloodshed ‚Äî both
now and in the months and years ahead.
The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his statement.
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the vote.
I call on Her Excellency Ms. Condoleezza Rice,
Secretary of State of the United States of America.
Ms. Rice (United States of America): I am
pleased to join all here today to support this important
draft resolution. We have been brought to this day by
the good faith and the hard work of many in the
international community. I especially want to thank
you, Secretary-General Annan. I want to thank French
Foreign Minister Douste-Blazy for his hard work and
for his Government‚Äôs work, as well as the co-sponsors
of the draft resolution. But of course we owe the fullest
gratitude to Prime Minister Siniora of Lebanon and his
Government and to Prime Minister Olmert of Israel
and his Government. These democratic leaders have
served their people courageously through this
extremely trying and tumultuous time.
With the passage of this draft resolution, the
international community will help to open a path to
lasting peace between Lebanon and Israel that will end
the suffering and the violence of the past month. The
status quo that precipitated this conflict was unstable.
Since the conflict began, we have sought an immediate
end to the fighting. But we have also insisted that a
durable ceasefire requires a decisive change from the
status quo that produced this war. Today‚Äôs draft
resolution lays the foundation to achieve that goal, for
with this draft resolution a new, stronger, Lebanon can
emerge, with the world‚Äôs help. Now the hard and
urgent work of implementation begins.
Today‚Äôs draft resolution accomplishes three
important objectives. First, it puts in place a full
cessation of hostilities. There is an insistence on an
unconditional release of abducted Israeli soldiers.
Hizbollah must immediately cease its attacks on Israel,
and Israel must halt its offensive military operations in
Lebanon, while reserving the right of any sovereign
State to defend itself. It is my understanding that the
Lebanese Cabinet will vote on Saturday concerning the
resolution, and the Government of Israel on Sunday. As
the Secretary-General has just noted, he will help the
parties to establish a timeline for the implementation of
this very important cessation of hostilities.
In addition to respecting the draft resolution‚Äôs call
for a full cessation of hostilities, we believe that all
parties should take action to protect civilians, as was
called for in the four principles of the 1996
understanding. We urge the Governments of Lebanon
and Israel to commit to ending large-scale violence.
Hizbollah faces a clear choice between war and peace,
and the world should help to ensure that that choice is
the right one.
Secondly, this draft resolution will help the
democratic Government of Lebanon to expand its
sovereign authority, as called for in resolution 1559
(2004). It will do so by creating a new international
force that builds on the current United Nations force in
Lebanon, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL). Although it will bear the same name, this
will not be the same force; it will be an enhanced
UNIFIL. As the Government of Lebanon has requested,
this new force will have an expanded mandate, a
greater scope of operations, better equipment and much
larger numbers ‚Äî a target of 15,000 soldiers, a
sevenfold increase in its current strength.
The Lebanese armed forces, together with the
new stabilization force, will deploy to the South of the
country to protect the Lebanese people and to ensure
that no armed groups like Hizbollah can threaten
stability. As that deployment occurs, Israel will
S/PV.5511
06-464916
withdraw to behind the Blue Line. Today‚Äôs draft
resolution makes clear that these are parallel processes,
and it also calls for the opening of Lebanese harbours
and airports, which we expect will be for verifiably
civilian purposes.
With the deployment and the withdrawal, a full
ceasefire will go into effect. The Council has said that
it intends to adopt another draft resolution with further
measures to help that ceasefire become permanent. We
also look forward to the Secretary-General‚Äôs proposals
to fully implement resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680
(2006), including the question of disarmament. To
further strengthen Lebanon‚Äôs democracy, the
international community will also impose a binding
embargo on all weapons heading into that country
without the Government‚Äôs consent. Today, we call upon
every State, especially Iran and Syria, to respect the
sovereignty of the Lebanese Government and the will
of the international community.
Finally, the draft resolution clearly lays out the
political principles to secure a lasting peace: no foreign
forces, no weapons and no authority in Lebanon other
than that of the independent Lebanese Government,
which must have complete sovereignty over its entire
country. Those principles represent a long-standing
international consensus that was first expressed in
United Nations resolution 425 (1978), then affirmed in
the Taif Accords and reaffirmed in resolutions 1559
(2004) and 1680 (2006). On 16 July, the Group of
Eight leaders endorsed the same political conditions in
Saint Petersburg, and 10 days later the Lebanon Core
Group supported those principles in the Rome
conference.
The draft resolution also offers a way forward to
implement resolution 1680 (2006), which addresses the
delineation of the Lebanese border, including the
Sheba‚Äôa farms. We must ensure Israel‚Äôs security and
respect the underlying framework to achieve a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region, in
accordance with resolution 425 (1978).
Today in no way marks the end of our common
efforts. In many respects, the hard work of diplomacy
is only just beginning. In many respects, although it is
our hope that the draft resolution will lead to the
cessation of large-scale hostilities, no one can expect
an immediate end to all acts of violence. The
conditions of a lasting peace must be nurtured over
time, with the good will of the Lebanese and Israeli
Governments and with the sustained commitment of
the international community that we have undertaken
here.
Our most pressing challenge now is to help
thousands of displaced people within Lebanon to return
to their homes and rebuild their lives. The
reconstruction of Lebanon will be led by the
Government of Lebanon, but it will demand the
generosity of the entire international community. For
its part, the United States will continue working with
the Governments of Lebanon and Israel to ease the
suffering of the Lebanese people. Let me join the
Secretary-General in applauding the extraordinary
work of humanitarian workers and United Nations
workers who, at great risk to themselves, have taken up
the cause of suffering people during this turbulent time.
The United States has already committed
substantial resources to the humanitarian efforts in
Lebanon and Israel. In the critical days and weeks
following a cessation of hostilities, we plan to do even
more ‚Äî beginning now ‚Äî by increasing our
immediate assistance to Lebanon to $50 million. The
United States will coordinate closely with other major
donors, with the international financial institutions and
with all who are committed to Lebanon‚Äôs future. We
will also encourage the active involvement of the
private sector in Lebanon‚Äôs reconstruction. Through
our common efforts, we must help the people of
Lebanon to emerge from this conflict more prosperous
and stronger than ever.
The past month has been marked by
overwhelming suffering, heartache and loss, both in
Lebanon and in Israel. The draft resolution is
refreshingly clear that this tragedy began six years
after Israel withdrew completely from Lebanon and
Hizbollah crossed an international boundary, captured
and killed Israeli soldiers and began firing thousands of
rockets into Israeli cities. Hizbollah and its sponsors
have brought devastation upon the people of Lebanon,
dragging them into a war that they did not choose and
exploiting them as human shields.
The people of the Middle East have lived too
long at the mercy of extremists. It is time to build a
more hopeful future. The draft resolution shows us the
way. It is now the solemn responsibility of the
international community to help the people of Lebanon
and the people of Israel to transform this tragedy into
opportunity ‚Äî an opportunity to overcome old patterns
S/PV.5511
706-46491
of violence and to build a new foundation for stable,
sustainable and comprehensive peace.
We have embarked upon an ambitious course. Yet
it is the right course. It is the only realistic and
effective course, and we must see it through, for it is
the only way to help the people of Lebanon, the people
of Israel and all the people of the Middle East secure
the lasting peace that they both desire and deserve.
The President: I now call on His Excellency
Mr. Philippe Douste-Blazy, Minister for Foreign
Affairs of France.
Mr. Douste-Blazy (France) (spoke in French):
Finally, the Security Council is deciding to put an end
to the war in Lebanon and Israel. Finally, it is putting
an end to the destruction, to the plight of hundreds of
thousands of displaced people on both sides of the
border, to an economic and humanitarian situation that
has grown more and more tragic with each passing day.
Today, the international community is shouldering its
responsibilities; we are shouldering our responsibilities.
Certainly, the time spent in negotiations seemed, for
some, to delay the moment of decision, but for France
and for the entire Security Council, it was a matter of
reaching a long-term comprehensive and political
solution.
Since the beginning of the conflict, France has
called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, a
lifting of the blockade imposed on Lebanese ports and
airports, and the return of displaced civilians. We must
then create the conditions for a way out of the crisis so
that we can swiftly achieve a lasting ceasefire. The
stability and equilibrium not only of Lebanon and
Israel, but of the entire region, depend on it.
The settlement on which we have worked must,
as the President of the French Republic has
emphasized, respect a twofold imperative. It must
allow Lebanon‚Äôs sovereignty to be restored throughout
its entire territory and it must guarantee Israel‚Äôs right to
security.
France has played a very active part in the search
for a solution. France is linked to Lebanon by deep
historical and cultural ties and by strong and ongoing
relations with the countries of the region. We are also
very attached to the sovereignty and the independence
of that country. On the strength of that imperative and
of our close ties with all the actors, France wishes to
reaffirm Israel‚Äôs right to security.
It is from that perspective, too, and in that spirit
that France worked intensively with its partners,
including the United States ‚Äî which I would like to
thank for its support, and in particular Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice ‚Äî to craft a draft resolution
that takes all of those elements into account.
Decisive elements have come into play that have
enabled the present result. The Council of Ministers of
Lebanon announced its intention to deploy its army in
southern Lebanon with the support of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). France
welcomed that initiative, which it deems to be a major
event. It is an historic turning point for that country.
The deployment of Lebanon‚Äôs army is an
essential element for restoring the sovereignty and
authority of Lebanon throughout its entire territory.
Furthermore, that decision meets a recurrent demand of
the international community that is reiterated in many
resolutions. We were duty-bound to respect that
decision. It was our responsibility to take note of it.
Both Lebanon and Israel submitted certain
demands to us. They shared certain expectations with us.
France heeded them and the international community
responded to them. That is the thrust of today‚Äôs draft
resolution. That seems to us the best guarantee for a
lasting ceasefire and for a long-term solution.
The main thing, first of all, is to secure a
cessation of hostilities and to immediately start a
process that will lead to the deployment of the
Lebanese army in the South, with the assistance of a
reinforced UNIFIL. That will occur concomitantly with
the gradual, progressive withdrawal of the Israeli army
south of the Blue Line. It is also essential to begin
resolving border issues, particularly that of the Sheba‚Äôa
farms. That question goes to the heart of the conflict.
For the first time, today‚Äôs draft resolution starts a
process, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, to
address that question. In that respect, the Security
Council has taken due note of the seven-point plan of
Mr. Siniora.
Finally, we wanted to set down from this moment
the principles and elements of a lasting ceasefire and a
comprehensive political solution. Through today‚Äôs draft
resolution, the Security Council is responding to the
request of the Lebanese authorities that UNIFIL be
strengthened by a proposed 15,000 servicemen. I
should like on this occasion to pay solemn tribute to
the United Nations personnel in Lebanon who have
S/PV.5511
06-464918
demonstrated self-denial and courage in this crisis,
some of whom, unfortunately, have paid with their
lives for their devotion to the cause of peace.
I should like to make it clear that the mandate
that the Security Council is giving UNIFIL is not one
that imposes peace. UNIFIL will help the Lebanese
Government in several of its missions, including the
deployment of its army to the South, humanitarian
assistance to the people and assistance to help
displaced persons return. It will also be responsible for
monitoring the cessation of hostilities, and then for
observing compliance by the parties with the
permanent ceasefire and the Blue Line.
We call upon all the parties to strictly respect the
personnel, equipment and premises of the United
Nations, whose security must be guaranteed in all
circumstances. France, finally, believes it crucial that
many countries respond favourably and expeditiously
to the request of the Lebanese authorities by
contributing to a reinforced UNIFIL. France is already
present in UNIFIL and will consider, alongside its
European partners, the possible supplementary support
that it may be able to give to the Force.
I express the hope that today will be the first day
of restored peace and stability in the Middle East. It is
important that what the Security Council is offering
Lebanon today, the international community offer the
Palestinian people in the future. The lives and the hope
of millions of people who are counting on us are at
stake. At stake, too, is the future of an entire region that
has suffered too much and must find peace once again.
The message of the international community is clear. We
need to replace a culture of hatred, mistrust and rejection
with a culture of trust, mindfulness and dialogue.
The President: I now call on the First Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Qatar, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin
Jabr Al-Thani.
Sheikh Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At
the outset, I would like to thank the delegations of
France and the United States for their recent efforts to
improve the language of the draft resolution submitted
by them to the Security Council on the situation in the
Middle East.
While thanking them for taking into consideration
some of the important points that we have raised
regarding the substance of the draft resolution, I
reaffirm our position that, for the sake of stopping the
bloodshed of innocents, the Security Council should
have adopted a resolution providing for an immediate
ceasefire from the very first day of the current
hostilities and should have dealt with other questions
subsequently.
However, that conviction does not necessarily
indicate our satisfaction with the adoption of a draft
resolution that lacks balance and overlooks the
accumulated, complicated historical, social and
geopolitical factors that have culminated in the current
situation in the region. The draft resolution fails to
adequately take into consideration the interests, unity,
stability and territorial integrity of Lebanon. Therefore,
we still have some comments regarding the draft
resolution.
The draft resolution does not clearly and
explicitly address the horrors of destruction caused by
the Israeli aggression against innocent civilians and the
Lebanese infrastructure. Moreover, it does not clearly
spell out Israel‚Äôs legal and humanitarian responsibility
for that destruction or address in a balanced manner the
question of the Lebanese prisoners, detainees and
abducted persons in Israeli prisons, despite the fact that
the exchange of prisoners and detainees is the logical
and realistic way to settle this question.
Nevertheless, we have accepted the draft
resolution in its present form in order to stop the
bloodshed of innocents and to spare Lebanon and the
region further horror and destruction.
It is our understanding that, once the draft
resolution is adopted, it obligates both parties to halt
hostilities and provides for the immediate withdrawal
of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, and that any
breaches committed between the end of hostilities and
the achievement of withdrawal and a ceasefire will be
governed by the April Understanding of 1996. In
addition, the draft resolution will lead to the reopening
of the Lebanese ports and airports and the return of the
displaced persons to their homes immediately upon its
adoption. It is also our understanding that the draft
resolution assigns sole responsibility to the Lebanese
Government for dealing with the armed phenomena in
the South and that the area between the Blue Line and
the Litani river is subject to the exclusive control of the
Lebanese Government.
We welcome the fact that the draft resolution is
limited to augmenting the United Nations Interim
S/PV.5511
906-46491
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), that its mandate will
continue to be subject to the provisions of Chapter VI
of the Charter, and that, as I have been assured by the
sponsors of the draft, any reference to international
forces in the draft resolution means UNIFIL. On this
occasion, we call upon the contributing States or those
States that intend to contribute to UNIFIL to dispatch
their forces promptly.
Furthermore, it is our understanding that the
Secretary-General will urgently take all the necessary
measures to settle the question of the Sheba‚Äôa farms in
accordance with the provisions of the seven-point plan
endorsed by the Lebanese Government in that regard.
We are convinced that it is still possible for the Council
to play an effective and substantive role in settling this
crisis. We will work with peace-loving States in
following up this question in the interest of security
and stability in Lebanon.
I would like to single out paragraph 18 of the
draft resolution, which stresses the need to achieve a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle
East. Failure to deal effectively and objectively with
this crisis and its root causes has led to a great deal of
turbulence and tension in the region, and this has
manifested itself in the events unfolding in Lebanon
and in Palestine. We have all witnessed ‚Äî and,
regrettably, continue to witness ‚Äî the continued
aggression against Gaza and its inhabitants.
I wish particularly to inform the Council that the
Council of the League of Arab States has unanimously
adopted a decision to resubmit the question of the
Arab-Israeli conflict to the Security Council, now that
everyone has recognized the failure of the peace
process in its present form. All of the Arab States will
submit an official request for the convening of a high-
level meeting of the Security Council next September
in order to agree on a new track towards the
establishment of a just peace in the region within a set
time frame.
The Security Council bears a major responsibility
towards millions in the region whose lives and future
are threatened by the conflict, which is turning their
lives into an inferno. The Council must discharge that
responsibility effectively, justly and fully.
The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft
resolution (S/2006/640) before it. If I hear no objection,
I shall now put the draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1701 (2006).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
I call on Her Excellency Ms. Dora Bakoyannis,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece.
Ms. Bakoyannis (Greece): For the past month
the world has borne witness to another tragic chapter in
the history of the Middle East, an unbearable addition
to the pain of that long-suffering region. The images of
helpless children and mothers, wounded, sick and
despondent victims on either side of the conflict,
untold destruction and unimaginable pain, have
haunted all of us. This has shown once more how much
we, as an international community, have failed the
hopes and dreams and aspirations of those people.
Greece, from the very first moment of the outbreak
of the current crisis, has called for an immediate
ceasefire. War is not and cannot be the answer to
anything. Violence has never solved any problem. It
only serves to breed more violence and to create a new
generation full of hatred, devoid of hope and keen on
revenge ‚Äî a nurturing field for extremism and terrorism.
The Middle East has been suffering from this
never-ending cycle of vicious wars and unstable peace,
broken promises, lost lives and unspeakable tragedy
not for years, but for decades. History has proven time
and again that neither victory on the battlefield nor
blind violence against innocent civilians, neither
suicide bombings nor Katyusha rockets, have ever
solved, or ever will solve, the problems of the Middle
East ‚Äî or any other region for that matter. These are
issues that need political solutions brought about
through diplomatic means, in a spirit of compromise,
mutual respect and acceptance.
The resolution we have just adopted here today is
trying to do precisely that. It offers the basis for a
S/PV.5511
06-4649110
political solution to this long-lasting ‚Äî and,
admittedly, extremely difficult and complex ‚Äî
problem. It also offers the framework for a political
process with concrete goals and specific benchmarks
and time frames.
Full respect for the sovereignty, political
independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon is the
first and foremost of those benchmarks. Security
Council resolutions 425 (1978), 1559 (2004) and 1680
(2006) must be fully implemented. After all, it is a
matter of principle that all Security Council resolutions
must be fully respected and properly implemented.
In the past two years, the international
community has done exceptional work in ridding
Lebanon of any foreign presence. It is therefore not
conceivable that it would accept foreign occupation of
any part of Lebanese national territory. Occupation by
any foreign force, anywhere in the world, is not
admissible in any way or on any pretext. It is
imperative for the Lebanese Government to take
effective and immediate control of Lebanese territory
in its entirety through the withdrawal of the Israeli
military forces and the deployment of the Lebanese
army. It is also imperative to proceed, as soon as
possible, with the delineation of the international
borders of Lebanon, including Sheba‚Äôa farms. The
Secretary-General, in presenting his proposals, should
take into consideration the seven points of the Siniora
plan.
At the same time, Israel‚Äôs legitimate security
concerns are well understood and need to be properly
addressed. We continue, though, to believe that, while
preserving the right of self-defence, Israel must respect
its obligations under international law, including
international humanitarian law.
We see today‚Äôs resolution as a first, but very
important, step towards a lasting and sustainable peace.
We are fully aware that a lot remains to be done. We
need to make sure that this resolution is fully
implemented. The bloodshed has to stop, and it has to
stop now. The bombings have to stop, and they have to
stop now. The suffering of the civilians has to stop, and
it has to stop now.
Greece responded immediately to the enormous
humanitarian effort under way in Lebanon. But the
ongoing hostilities hamper our ability to reach those
most in need and to alleviate their pain.
Now that the end of hostilities is hopefully in
sight, we stand ready, together with the rest of the
international community, and especially the countries
of the region, to help in the enormous effort for the
reconstruction of a shattered country, the immediate
return of refugees to their homes and, hopefully, the
dawn of a new day over both Lebanon and Israel.
It is in that respect that this resolution deserves
our support and, even more important, deserves our
commitment to work very hard in the coming days on
the crucial steps that need to follow if we want our
efforts to bring tangible results and not end in one
more disappointing failure.
It is in that spirit that we call upon all parties to
set aside their fears and disappointments and, difficult
as it might be, to make the necessary commitment and
effort to overcome the current crisis and build a better
future for their peoples.
At this particularly critical juncture in the history
of the Middle East, we must not lose sight of the bigger
picture and allow ourselves to forget the suffering and
the plight of the Palestinian people in the West Bank
and Gaza. The question of Palestine, central to the
whole Middle East conflict, should be addressed with
the utmost urgency. As long as the Palestine issue
remains unresolved, it is clear that there will be no
peace in the region.
We must strive to create, as soon as possible, the
necessary conditions for the genuine and earnest
re-launching of a peace process for the achievement of
a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle
East, based on all relevant Security Council
resolutions, including resolutions 242 (1967), 338
(1973), 1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003), as well as on the
Madrid terms of reference and the principle of land for
peace, for the sake of the people in all of the region.
The President: I call now on Her Excellency
Mrs. Margaret Beckett, M.P., Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Mrs. Beckett (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom very much welcomes the adoption of this
resolution. Its objectives are clear: to bring about full
cessation of hostilities, to create the space for an urgent
humanitarian relief effort and to begin a process
leading to a permanent ceasefire and a durable peace.
That last point is crucial. It is why it has taken long and
S/PV.5511
1106-46491
intensive negotiations to arrive at today‚Äôs decision. We
needed to achieve a resolution that looked beyond the
short term and held out the prospect of a lasting
solution. That meant agreeing upon a text that took
sufficient account of the positions of both parties: the
sovereign and elected Governments of Lebanon and of
Israel. That was not straightforward; it has taken time
and effort. But the United Kingdom firmly believes it
was the right thing to do.
The resolution underlines the international
community‚Äôs determination to support the Lebanese
people and Government in making a new start, for
there can be no going back to the way things were. We
have seen the tragic consequences of that all too
clearly in the past weeks: hundreds of dead ‚Äî mostly
civilians ‚Äî thousands wounded and hundreds of
thousands displaced. We grieve for and with them, and
we offer our condolences to the Governments of
Lebanon and of Israel, and to the families of all those
affected, for the losses they have suffered. Such
tragedies must not be repeated, and we will do all we
can to help Lebanon move forward to live in peace and
prosperity with all its neighbours.
The immediate priority is to address the
humanitarian crisis. United Nations agencies have been
working tirelessly, but have faced extremely difficult
conditions on the ground. We hope a full cessation of
hostilities will allow for rapid expansion of those
efforts and those of other relief organizations and
bilateral donors; the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) will have an important role to play
in that regard.
The United Kingdom will play its full part. We
are taking immediate steps to provide practical and
other support for the Government of Lebanon. The
British team of humanitarian experts and experts in
post-conflict reconstruction has been in Lebanon, and
Prime Minister Blair has been in touch with Lebanese
Prime Minister Siniora about ways in which the United
Kingdom can support the recovery effort. The United
Kingdom is contributing ¬£6.2 million to meet priority
relief needs in Lebanon. Most of that will be channelled
through United Nations agencies. We will also support the
Red Cross and a number of non-governmental
organizations, whose role will be critical.
Faced with a crisis, the international community
is often generous in its response. But that very
generosity can pose a challenge of coordination. So we
are grateful to the United Nations for the leading role it
is playing on that front. We urge all parties to take all
necessary measures to ensure that humanitarian relief
workers can go about their life-saving business without
hindrance or fear of attack.
At the heart of this resolution is the need to
pursue the twin objectives of Lebanese sovereignty and
Israeli security. We cannot achieve one unless we
guarantee the other. And that is why this resolution sets
out a framework for establishing peace, security and
stability in southern Lebanon on the basis of extending
the Government of Lebanon‚Äôs control throughout its
territory and, in particular, through implementation of
Security Council resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680
(2006). For far too long, Lebanon has suffered from
occupation, interference and conflict, and it is the
civilian population, both in Lebanon and in Israel,
which has suffered most. As Prime Minister Siniora has
said, this must now end.
But we must also see an end to Hizbollah‚Äôs
random attacks continually directed against Israeli
civilians. No country can accept its citizens having to
live under the shadow of rockets fired from across the
border. Hizbollah faces a historic choice: whether to
continue on the path of violence and destruction or to
support the aspirations of the Lebanese people for a
peaceful future through a political path which is itself a
path of peace.
To implement this resolution we look first and
foremost to all the parties to respect its terms. But we
also look to those with influence to play their part.
Hizbollah‚Äôs backers, notably Syria and Iran, must now
consider their positions ‚Äî whether they want to work
with the rest of the international community to build a
peaceful future in the region or to oppose those efforts,
at a high cost to the region and ultimately to
themselves. I look to their leaders now to give full
support, both to this resolution and to resolutions 1559
(2004) and 1680 (2006), including by denying support
for continued warfare to Hizbollah and refraining from
other actions that destabilize the region.
And I cannot make such an observation without
referring to the recent remarks about Israel by the
President of Iran. Such comments are wholly
unacceptable in themselves, and they have the capacity
to promote further violence.
Our chief focus today is inevitably on the crisis in
Lebanon. But we must, at all costs, as a number of
S/PV.5511
06-4649112
colleagues have said, not lose sight also of the situation
in Gaza, where violence continues to take a heavy toll
and where the humanitarian situation of the Palestinian
people ‚Äî itself compounded by conflict ‚Äî continues
to cause great concern.
We reiterate our full support for President Abbas
and others who are working to resolve the current
situation, and we offer our condolences to Palestinians
on their losses. Real peace throughout the Middle East
can come only on the basis of a lasting, comprehensive
settlement. As our Prime Minister said in his speech in
Los Angeles on 1 August, we need a new strategy for
the Middle East, one that tackles extremism and
promotes moderation and reconciliation. Our priority
must be to create the conditions for an early
resumption of negotiations based on the Quartet road
map. There is no military solution to these problems.
Negotiation is the only viable way to bring peace and
prosperity to the people throughout the Middle East.
Our own Prime Minister has announced this
evening his intention to visit the region, in particular
Israel and Palestine, over the coming period, and to
consult those there ‚Äî and, of course, members of the
Quartet ‚Äî on what might be the best way forward.
The step we are taking in this resolution today, to
bring peace to Lebanon, must be part of a larger
process to bring peace to all of the people of the region
as a whole. The United Kingdom will do all it can to
help bring this about.
The President: I call now on Mr. Per Stig
Moeller, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark, His
Excellency.
Mr. Moeller (Denmark): For four weeks, we
have witnessed a violent conflict between Israel and
Hizbollah, causing untold suffering and devastation on
both sides. I am deeply shocked by the unacceptably
high number of casualties among innocent civilians.
Almost one million people have fled their homes in
southern Lebanon and northern Israel.
In order to stop further human suffering and pave
the way for a negotiated political solution, the
hostilities must end immediately. There is no military
solution to this crisis. To the contrary, further violence
and combat will only fuel the hatred and fanaticism
that have obstructed a comprehensive settlement of the
Middle East conflict for so long. We must not let the
extremists win and set the agenda for the future.
Intense diplomatic efforts have been carried out
in recent weeks by all parties around this table in order
to reach a solution. I am convinced that this resolution
is the necessary and indispensable step towards the
cessation of the hostilities, a permanent ceasefire and a
long-term solution to the conflict.
There are several parties responsible for this
conflict. Hizbollah is the main cause. We have also
called on Syria and Iran to act responsibly and on
Israel to show the utmost restraint and to avoid
disproportionate action, and have warned it against
destroying Lebanon in its fight against Hizbollah.
We mourn the deaths of innocent men, women
and children. Our hearts go out to their bereaved
families and to the peoples of Lebanon and Israel. The
cruelty of war reminds us of our common obligation to
maintain international peace and security and to seek
solutions by peaceful means to all conflicts. I believe
that it is high time to look forward and finally to lay
the foundations for a stable and durable peace in that
troubled region.
We urge the Governments of Lebanon and Israel
to agree to the principles and elements mentioned in
the resolution in order to arrive at a long-term solution.
We pledge our full support for the efforts of the
Secretary-General in that regard and stand ready to
assist wherever possible.
We cannot and must not return to the status quo
ante. The root causes of the conflict should be
addressed urgently. As long as armed forces outside the
control of the Government operate in and from
Lebanon, instability will prevail.
Denmark stands firmly behind Prime Minister
Siniora in Beirut and the fragile Lebanese democracy.
The overriding challenge is to safeguard a stable and
democratic future for Lebanon and to avoid the
strengthening of extremism in general in the region.
One of the main objectives of today‚Äôs resolution
is to ensure the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity
and political independence of Lebanon in line with
resolution 1559 (2004). With a view to achieving those
goals, Denmark welcomes the decision of the
Government of Lebanon to deploy 15,000 troops in
southern Lebanon and supports the enhancement of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in numbers,
equipment, mandate and scope of operations.
S/PV.5511
1306-46491
The humanitarian efforts carried out by the
United Nations and other relief organizations have
been essential in saving human lives. It is imperative
that they be guaranteed safety and unhindered access.
Denmark has contributed to those efforts and to the
humanitarian appeal from the United Nations, and we
stand ready to extend further assistance.
In conclusion, we have today taken an important
first step in trying to end this bloody and senseless
conflict. To break the logic of war and replace it with
the logic of peace, we have now endorsed a road map
for a long-term solution. To get there, however, we are
dependent on the political will and strength of all
parties. The international community can and must
facilitate and support, but in the end, only the parties
can make the peace, and they must do so to the benefit
of the citizens of their countries. They deserve it. I urge
them to do so.
The President: I shall now give the floor to the
representative of China.
Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
We wish to welcome you, Sir, and to thank you for
personally presiding over today‚Äôs meeting. We would
also like to welcome Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and the foreign ministers who are participating in this
meeting.
Since the Lebanon-Israel conflict broke out on 12
July, China has repeatedly called upon all the parties to
the conflict to practise the utmost restraint, and has
called for the immediate cessation of hostilities so as to
avoid a further escalation of the situation and a greater
humanitarian crisis. It has been nearly a month since
the onset of the bloody Lebanon-Israel conflict, which
has killed or injured thousands of innocent civilians
and forced a million people to flee their homes. In the
conflict, even United Nations peacekeepers have not
been spared.
China condemns the excessive use of force and
attacks on civilians, civilian facilities and United
Nations personnel. We strongly advocate early Security
Council action to achieve an immediate and
comprehensive ceasefire, halt the current conflict,
maintain peace and stability in the Middle East, and
relieve the humanitarian disaster.
After rounds of difficult negotiations by the
parties concerned, the Security Council has finally
reached consensus on the resolution on the conflict in
the Middle East. In the course of consultations, China
repeatedly emphasized that any Security Council
resolution and framework of settlement must respect
and reflect the concerns of all parties involved,
especially the concerns of Lebanon and the Arab
countries. We believe that the resolution before us,
integrating the seven-point proposal of the Lebanese
Government, embodies some important elements,
including its calls for a full cessation of hostilities and
for the Lebanese Government to deploy its armed
forces throughout the South, together with the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), as the
Israeli army withdraws behind the Blue Line.
The resolution also lays out detailed provisions
for the new mandates of UNIFIL. Those provide a
good foundation for future efforts to achieve long-term
political solutions to the Lebanon-Israel issue. We note
that Lebanon, Israel and the Arab countries hold no
objections to the resolution. Given the above
considerations, China voted in favour of resolution
1701 (2006).
The adoption of resolution 1701 (2006) is just the
first step, and the parties concerned face more arduous
tasks. China hopes that the parties will earnestly
implement the resolution and, in particular, assisted by
Secretary-General Annan, reach consensus at an early
date on a comprehensive, lasting and fair framework
for the political settlement of the conflict and restore
local peace and stability as soon as possible. At the
same time, the international community should step up
its urgent humanitarian relief efforts for Lebanon and
help the Lebanese people to rebuild their homeland.
Finally, I take this opportunity to emphasize that,
while focusing attention on the Lebanon-Israel conflict,
the international community should not neglect or
forget the ongoing sufferings of the Palestinian people.
We hope that, with the joint efforts of Israel and the
Arab countries, and on the basis of the relevant United
Nations resolutions and the principle of land for peace,
the Middle East peace process will be revitalized and a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace achieved in the
Middle East at an early date.
The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of Slovakia.
Mr. Burian (Slovakia): Slovakia, as one of the
sponsors of resolution 1701 (2006), voted in favour of
it because we believe that it provides an important
basis for a full cessation of hostilities, for ending the
S/PV.5511
06-4649114
suffering of civilians in Lebanon and Israel, and for
starting the process of a comprehensive and lasting
settlement of the Lebanese crisis. We consider the
resolution to be the first step in addressing fully and
urgently all causes that have led to the current crisis.
We are convinced that there is no military
solution to the Lebanese crisis, just as there is no
military solution to the Middle East conflict in general.
In that regard, we urge all parties to abide by the
resolution and immediately to stop the hostilities and
violence and to reach an agreement on a permanent
ceasefire. In our view, a lasting solution can be reached
only through peaceful negotiations and the full
implementation of all relevant resolutions of the
Security Council.
We support the territorial integrity, sovereignty
and political independence of Lebanon. To that end, we
believe that they can be best achieved through the full
implementation of resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680
(2006), enabling the Government of Lebanon to
assume full control over all its territory. That also
means taking appropriate measures against the illegal
movement of arms and people across its borders and
against illegal attacks on the territory of neighbouring
States. The international community should assist the
Lebanese Government to achieve that goal.
In that regard, we believe that it is necessary to
take all steps to expeditiously enhance the strength and
mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) in order to allow it to cope
efficiently and effectively with the tasks envisaged by
the resolution. Slovakia is ready to contribute to
enhancing UNIFIL‚Äôs capacities.
Finally, it is of the utmost importance for the
international community to take immediate steps to
address the extremely difficult humanitarian situation
of thousands of refugees and internally displaced
persons and to assist in their return home.
In conclusion, we would like to underline that
this resolution cannot be a substitute for agreement by
the parties on the basic principles of a long-term and
lasting solution. In that respect, we call once again on
all parties to extend their full cooperation in achieving
a sustainable and lasting solution to the Lebanese
crisis.
The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of the Russian Federation.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): Another tragic chapter of the history of the
Middle East conflict has now been written. For almost
a month, before the eyes of the entire world, innocent
civilians in Lebanon and Israel have been dying and
hundreds of thousands of Lebanese citizens have been
forced to abandon their homes. Serious damage has
been done to Lebanon‚Äôs civilian infrastructure.
Personnel of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) have been in an extremely difficult
situation and have suffered casualties.
These wounds will take a long time to heal ‚Äî
both in Lebanon and in the memory of the world
community. From the very first days of the
confrontation between Israel and Lebanon, Russia has
insisted on an immediate ceasefire to prevent further
casualties and to bring an end to suffering among the
civilian population both in Lebanon and in Israel.
We are convinced that the prime cause of the
tragedy that has unfolded in Lebanon, and of the
broad-scale humanitarian disaster, was not solely the
train of events with which we are all familiar, but also
the lack of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle
East. It is possible that similar events will continue to
shake the Middle East until decisive action is taken to
resolve the region‚Äôs fundamental problems. In that
context, it is increasingly essential to engage in
comprehensive consideration of all aspects of the
Middle East situation, without exception, on the basis
of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.
It took an unjustifiably long time to draft the
Council resolution we have just adopted. Russia did
everything it could to accelerate the process, both in
our contacts with the parties and around the negotiating
table. It was this that guided us when we proposed our
draft resolution yesterday, calling for a humanitarian
ceasefire in Lebanon and for urgent diplomatic efforts
to resolve the crisis.
But, as it proved possible today to produce an
agreed text of a broader Security Council draft
resolution on Lebanon, the Russian Federation decided
to support that text. It reflects Russia‚Äôs key demand for
an immediate cessation hostilities, it takes into account
the legitimate demands of Lebanon and it includes
provisions that meet the security interests of Israel. We
call upon the parties to show the necessary political
will and strictly follow the course of action outlined in
the resolution.
S/PV.5511
1506-46491
For its part, Russia will continue steadfastly to
promote the achievement of a comprehensive
settlement in the Middle East, pursuant to the decisions
taken by the Security Council.
The President: I call next on the representative
of Argentina.
Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): My
country supported and voted in favour of the draft
resolution we have just adopted, essentially because
the priority in this conflict was and remains to declare
an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to
violent confrontation. That has been my country‚Äôs
position ever since the outbreak of this crisis between
Israel and Lebanon on 12 July, and we have
unequivocally stated that at all relevant meetings of the
Security Council and in other international forums.
We regret that the Council took a full month to
react in the face of this conflict and to shoulder its
responsibilities under the Charter. As I have said, our
chief concern throughout the conflict has been and
remains the fate of the civilian population. The figures
reveal eloquently that it is innocent civilians, both
Lebanese and Israeli, who have most suffered the
consequences of the violence. International
humanitarian law establishes clear obligations for the
parties with respect to the protection of civilians. The
principles of proportionality and differentiation must
be respected in all circumstances. For that reason,
Argentina has vigorously denounced all violations of
international humanitarian law and of human rights
that have taken place in the course of the conflict. We
call once again for an immediate end to all attacks on
civilian populations.
We now hope that the parties to the conflict will
take immediate steps to facilitate access by
humanitarian aid agencies to southern Lebanon and to
guarantee the safety and freedom of movement of
humanitarian aid workers. In the light of the particular
social and cultural characteristics of Lebanon, we
consider that among the top priorities should be to
provide assistance enabling internally displaced
persons to return to their homes as soon as possible.
It must be stated that the adoption of this
resolution should not be seen as the end of the road,
but rather as the beginning of a process that must take
us to a solution of the underlying problems that led to
this crisis. Here, we are convinced that additional
efforts must be made to fully implement all of the
Council‚Äôs decisions, in particular resolutions 425
(1978), 426 (1978), 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006).
With regard to the implementation of today‚Äôs
resolution, we believe that it is a priority to accelerate
preparations for the deployment of additional troops to
strengthen the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon so that Israel‚Äôs withdrawal from Lebanese
territory can take place as soon as possible. We are
confident that there will be significant contributions of
troops over the next few days.
With respect to the proposals to be developed by
the Secretary-General in pursuance of paragraph 10 of
the resolution, we would ask him to take into account
the seven-point plan adopted by the Lebanese Cabinet,
in particular with regard to the Sheba‚Äôa farms, as also
set out in the resolution we have adopted.
The crisis between Israel and Lebanon should not
make us lose sight of the serious situation in the
occupied Palestinian territories, in particular in the
Gaza Strip. To the contrary: the two matters are very
closely linked and, unfortunately, feed off each other.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is extremely grave
and continues to deteriorate daily. We hope that, over
the next few days, the Security Council will begin to
look at this issue with a view to putting an immediate
end to hostilities there as well.
Finally, let me stress once again the importance
that Argentina attaches to the achievement of a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle
East on the basis of Security Council resolutions, the
Madrid terms of reference, prior agreements among the
parties, the road map and the principle of land for
peace.
The President: I give the floor to the
representative of Japan.
Mr. Oshima (Japan): It is almost a month since
the hostilities started in the Middle East, engulfing
Lebanon and Israel. The fighting has caused an
enormous loss of civilian life, heartrending bloodshed
and the destruction of infrastructure on both sides. The
suffering of people in Lebanon and Israel increases
every day that the hostilities continue, and the threat to
peace and security in that vital region becomes even
greater as the fighting threatens to escalate. Japan
therefore strongly welcomes the unanimous adoption
of resolution 1701 (2006) calling for a full and
immediate cessation of hostilities by the parties in
S/PV.5511
06-4649116
conflict and for Israel and Lebanon to support a
permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution, based on
a set of negotiated principles and elements.
We wish to thank the sponsors, in particular
France and the United States, for their great efforts in
producing this outcome over weeks of hard
negotiations involving all the relevant parties under
extremely difficult circumstances ‚Äî especially, in the
Council, Ambassador John Bolton of the United States
and Ambassador de La Sabli√®re of France.
The package solution contained in the resolution,
being a child of political compromise reached through
arduous diplomatic exchanges, can satisfy no party
100 per cent. But it does represent a significant step
forward, providing a viable framework for an
immediate ceasefire and the avoidance of further
civilian casualties and destruction, which the
international community has been calling for since the
onset of the crisis, and for a sustainable solution to the
complex problems that have beset the region of
southern Lebanon for a long time ‚Äî if it is backed up
with the necessary political will and commitment of all
the parties concerned and supported by the
international community. In other words, the faithful
and complete implementation of the resolution is now
of vital importance, and we call on the Governments of
Lebanon and Israel and all the concerned parties, based
on the resolution, to bring about an immediate
ceasefire, to use the utmost restraint, to start
implementing the agreed political framework and to
exert the maximum effort to restore calm and stability
in the region.
We are also deeply concerned about the dire
humanitarian situation, particularly in Lebanon. It is
imperative to create the necessary environment for
Lebanon, with support from the international
community, to address the problems of internally
displaced persons in their hundreds and thousands, and
of refugees in the neighbouring countries, as well as
the rehabilitation of the country at the earliest possible
date. Here, I pay tribute to all the humanitarian
organizations and workers and all observers and troops
of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for
their perseverance and dedication.
We regret that it took such a long time for the
Council to act in the discharge of its responsibility on
this matter. Noting the delay in action, however, does
not diminish our appreciation of the sponsors. The
delay was not due to any lack of will or effort on their
part, or on the part of any member of the Council.
Be that as it may, having come all the way to this
critical juncture in dealing with the issue at hand, and
recognizing the need for the Security Council to
continue to act actively and in unity, Japan will
continue to work and cooperate closely with the other
members of the Council and the concerned countries to
ensure the effective implementation of the resolution.
Finally, while we need to deal with the Israel-
Lebanon conflict with all due attention and speed, we
must not forget to deal with the other situations in the
Middle East, in particular the Palestinian problem and
the increasingly dire humanitarian plight of the
Palestinian people.
In conclusion, Japan calls for a broad-based,
prompt international contribution and cooperation to
achieve the full implementation of the resolution. I
wish to state that Japan, for its part, will continue to
contribute actively to the efforts to restore peace and to
promote medium- and long-term stability and
reconstruction in Lebanon and the region as a whole.
The President: I give the floor to the
representative of the United Republic of Tanzania.
Mr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): We
join in welcoming the foreign ministers who are here
today.
We would like to thank the United States and
France for their tireless efforts, which made it possible
for the Security Council to vote on today‚Äôs important
resolution.
In a Government statement issued on 31 July,
Tanzania called for an immediate ceasefire in the
hostilities between Israel and Hizbollah in order to put
an end to the mounting deaths and the suffering of
innocent civilians and also to avert the further
destruction of property and civilian infrastructure.
The Government statement urged the
international community to intervene to end the
bloodshed. It regretted that so many innocent civilians
in Lebanon and in Israel had died and that many more
were being displaced in Lebanon, and called for urgent
action by the Security Council to resolve the crisis. It
emphasized the need to implement resolution 1559
(2004) and deeply regretted that so much time had
been spent before the Council could act.
S/PV.5511
1706-46491
It was with the same sense of urgency that we
welcomed the efforts that made possible the resolution,
which we believe creates the necessary framework for
a cessation of hostilities. Our short-term objective has
always been to stop further humanitarian casualties and
suffering and to allow immediate humanitarian access and
assistance. That is still our primary objective tonight.
Our second objective springs from the realization
that a political solution to the current crisis must also
be sought with urgency. In our view, any expectation
that military action will bring about a political solution
can only engender grave humanitarian consequences
and render it considerably harder to promote a political
solution, which must be preferred if sustainable peace
is to be attained.
It is also our view that the Government and the
entire nation of Lebanon need not be the victims of the
events that triggered the current crisis ‚Äî events which the
United Republic of Tanzania has condemned. However,
we have always believed that this crisis need not escalate
further. It was therefore with a sense of relief that we
received the news of the outcome of the efforts that made
it possible for us to vote in favour of the resolution.
We want to commend the Government of
Lebanon for its seven-point plan, which was
augmented by an offer to deploy 15,000 troops in
southern Lebanon to control its territory, in
collaboration with the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon. We also commend the Government of Israel
for having given that proposal due consideration.
The international community has an important
role to play in support of the resolution. We commend
potential troop-contributing countries and urge them to
act with urgency, and we appeal for assistance for the
return and resettlement of displaced persons and for the
reconstruction of Lebanon.
We also believe that the resolution that has been
adopted is but a first step. Its relevance and
effectiveness will demand the utmost good faith of the
parties. That will be critical if the present understanding is
to become a building block to a broader comprehensive
peace for the Middle East, and especially to a durable
solution to the Palestinian question.
The President: I now call on the representative
of Peru.
Mr. Pereyra Plasencia (Peru) (spoke in
Spanish): Peru voted in favour of this resolution, which
calls for a complete cessation of hostilities and which
we trust will mark the beginning of the end to the
destruction and the violence that have claimed so many
innocent lives in Lebanon and in northern Israel. That
is why we urge the parties to the conflict to comply
immediately and scrupulously with the cessation of
hostilities for which this resolution calls. We are
confident that that will enable humanitarian assistance
to reach populations in need as soon as possible.
We also ask that the strengthening of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) under the
terms authorized by this resolution take place as soon
as possible so that the Force can, together with the
Lebanese army, move in and fulfil the mandate with
which it has been entrusted. That action, in parallel
with the withdrawal of the Israeli army, is essential for
compliance with this resolution. Likewise, we trust that
the principles and elements included in this resolution
with a view to a definitive solution can be addressed as
soon as possible by the Governments of Lebanon and
of Israel.
Finally, Peru expresses its entire willingness to
continue to work constructively in the Security Council
to contribute to the reaching of a definitive solution to
this conflict.
The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ghana.
It is an honour for us to preside over this meeting,
which has been convened this evening to adopt the
resolution on Lebanon for which the world has been
waiting. The anxiety that has gripped the world since
the outbreak of the conflict and that has led some to
accuse the Security Council of inaction can now be laid
to rest. And our deepest wish is that today will mark a
truly new beginning not only for the people of Israel
and Lebanon, but for the entire region.
We wish to join others in expressing our profound
gratitude to Ambassador Jean-Marc de La Sabli√®re,
Permanent Representative of France, and Ambassador
John Bolton, Permanent Representative of the United
States of America, their Governments and their respective
teams for working tirelessly to achieve the consensus
that the resolution before us represents. Their dogged
determination to achieve results has enabled the
Council to do its duty to the peoples of the world.
The presence in our midst of United States
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her colleagues
S/PV.5511
06-4649118
from France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Denmark
and the State of Qatar underscores the fact no other
body can surpass the Security Council in the force of
its moral authority and its sheer diplomatic clout when
it acts in unity and remains faithful to its
responsibilities. We expect nothing less when we come
to grapple with the fundamental question of a
comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the long-
standing Middle East question. Clearly, the solution is
within the grasp of the Security Council, and we must
resolve to work together in a spirit of compromise to
bring to a speedy end the pain and suffering of the
peoples of that troubled region.
Therefore, I fully share the views of other
speakers who have stressed that the adoption of this
resolution should lead to the immediate cessation of
hostilities between Israel and Lebanon in order to bring
prompt relief to the 1 million displaced people who are
in dire need of humanitarian assistance and those who
suffer the rockets and the bombing.
Beyond that, I wish to reiterate that the adoption
of this resolution should also be seen, as others have
also noted, as an important step in the search for a
comprehensive solution to the Middle East question,
the core of which is the Palestinian question. In that
regard, the President of the Republic of Ghana, His
Excellency Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, and the
Ghanaian Government intend to work closely with the
other members of the Council in implementing the
two-State solution, which entails an independent
Palestinian State living side by side with Israel within
internationally recognized borders. The international
community, especially the Security Council, should
leave no stone unturned in tackling this problem and
seeing to its successful realization.
It is for those reasons that Ghana, which has
consistently supported the international consensus on
this question, decided to co-sponsor the present
resolution, and we are happy that it has been adopted
unanimously. Ghana, as a troop contributor to the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, is also
happy that the resolution seeks to enhance the Force‚Äôs
capacity and believes that that enhancement will make
a significant and positive contribution to the search for
peace in the Middle East.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.
I call now on His Excellency Mr. Tarek Mitri,
Minister of Culture and Special Envoy of the Council
of Ministers of Lebanon.
Mr. Mitri (Lebanon): Once again, the Security
Council is meeting in this Chamber. It has been one
long month since the Government of Lebanon began
urging ‚Äî let us say passionately calling out for ‚Äî a
ceasefire that would end the rain of bombs that has
devastated our country and end the reign of horror that
Israel has visited upon our people. For a month now, as
the world has continued to watch and as the
international community has continued to vacillate,
Israel has besieged and ravaged Lebanon, creating a
humanitarian and environmental disaster and shattering
our infrastructure and economy.
Israel says that this war is against Hezbollah, not
against Lebanon. Actually, the Israeli strategy of terror
is inflicted on all Lebanese. The indiscriminate murder
of more than 1,100 Lebanese civilians, a third of them
children, the massacres and the ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù of villages
and the wanton destruction of our infrastructure and
economy are nothing short of criminal. One quarter of
our population has been displaced, many of them with
no homes to return to and most of them desperately
low on fuel, food and medical supplies, while homes,
hospitals, factories and warehouses have been
demolished.
The direct cause of more than 1,000 deaths and
thousands of injuries is the obscenely disproportionate
and unjustifiable Israeli retaliation. There are many
cases documented by human rights organizations that
reveal a systematic failure by the Israeli army to
distinguish between combatants and civilians. In many
cases, the timing and intensity of the attack and the
absence of a military target, as well as the subsequent
strikes on rescuers, suggest that Israel forces
deliberately targeted civilians. Even today, a few hours
ago, a convoy of evacuated civilians from the city of
Marjayoun, escorted by the Red Cross, was targeted,
killing four and injuring 16.
After its first call for a ceasefire, the Lebanese
Government offered to the Rome Conference and to the
Security Council a comprehensive seven-point plan
developed through a process of national consensus,
which received the unanimous approval of the
Lebanese Council of Ministers as well as the support of
political and religious leaders and significant
international support.
S/PV.5511
1906-46491
A ceasefire that is incomplete is not a true
ceasefire. A ceasefire that by its terms cannot be
implemented is no ceasefire. A ceasefire that retains for
one side the right not to cease firing is not a ceasefire.
Lebanon has urgently requested a ceasefire that has the
possibility of being implemented so that all hostilities
should immediately cease ‚Äî and for good.
No one more than Lebanon wants to assure the
Council that we will not be here again in six weeks, six
months or even six years. The persistent invasions of
Lebanon demonstrate Israel‚Äôs continuing belief that
military actions will remedy the causes of crisis in the
region. This pattern of invasions demonstrates the
continuing threat facing Lebanon and the need for a
political solution rooted in international law, not the
result of the use of force ‚Äî a solution that will lead to
long-term stability, as set forth in our seven-point plan.
The people and the Government of Lebanon are
deeply appreciative of the efforts of so many in the
international community, most significantly, the efforts
of the Secretary-General and the members of the
Council, who have been working to bring to an
immediate end the ravaging of Lebanon. We
acknowledge all the valuable work expended by many
countries to reach a viable agreement. We appreciate
the genuine impatience of many with regard to the
delay in reaching agreement on the resolution.
Proposals to have a humanitarian truce were a case in
point. More important, we are grateful for the support
extended to our country and for the support that will
accompany us as we, hopefully, rise up from the ruins,
reconstruct and heal our injured country.
We appreciate the Security Council‚Äôs
acknowledgment of the Sheba‚Äôa farms problem. We
hope that the Security Council and the Secretary-
General will, in the period ahead, take the necessary
steps to resolve that issue, thereby removing one of the
underlying causes of the conflict.
I am sure that Council members understand that
the Lebanese are eager to see a true cessation of
hostilities and expect a strong determination on the
Council‚Äôs part to bring it about immediately. The
Lebanese, to be frank, are not confident in the Israeli
distinction between what is ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù and what is
‚Äúoffensive‚Äù. The end to military operations should be
unqualified.
The lifting of the blockade should also be
immediate upon cessation of hostilities. The
consequences of the blockade so far have been such
that the international community cannot allow the
humanitarian crisis to continue one more moment.
Humanitarian aid has been prevented from reaching
people in desperate need. Even today, Israel continues
to fire upon convoys of people attempting to reach
safety and help.
Our Government has decided to deploy the
Lebanese armed forces in southern Lebanon as the sole
military force, assisted by United Nations forces, the
moment Israel starts pulling back to the international
borders. To be sure, the United Nations Interim Force
in Lebanon (UNIFIL) will have to play the determining
role that is defined by this resolution. Let me pay
tribute here to the UNIFIL personnel for all they have
done for the sake of peace and for all that has been
done to them.
To be sure, as I have said, UNIFIL will have to
play the determining role that is defined in this
resolution. The Government of Lebanon therefore
urgently calls on the troop-contributing countries to act
swiftly on the strengthening and enhancement of
UNIFIL, to enable it to perform its duties as stipulated
in the resolution just adopted: to assist, support and
accompany the Lebanese population and Lebanese
armed forces and to monitor not just the cessation of
hostilities but also the ceasefire.
For any political solution to move forward, it
must address the root causes of this war, including the
continued Israeli occupation of Sheba‚Äôa farms and the
perennial threat to Lebanon‚Äôs security, as well as
Lebanon‚Äôs struggle to regain full sovereignty over all
its territory. We believe that a political resolution
rooted in international law and based on the seven-
point plan will lead to long-term stability.
The international community has a moral and
political obligation under the terms of the Charter of
the United Nations and the accepted norms of
international law to defend Lebanon‚Äôs sovereignty and
territorial integrity, as well as to protect the Lebanese
people under the relevant provisions of international
humanitarian law, including the Geneva Convention
and its Protocols, which Israel has repeatedly and
wilfully violated.
If Israel were to realize that the peoples of the
Middle East cannot be cowed into submission and that
they aspire only to live in freedom and dignity, this
could also be a stepping stone to a final solution of the
S/PV.5511
06-4649120
wider Arab-Israeli conflict which has plagued our
region for 60 years. The 2002 Arab Summit in Beirut,
which called for a just, comprehensive and lasting
peace based on the principle of land for peace is the
way forward. A political solution cannot, however, be
implemented as long as Israel continues to occupy
Arab land in Lebanon, Palestine and the Syrian Golan
Heights and wages war on innocent people.
The Lebanese Council of Ministers will convene
urgently tomorrow to consider this important
resolution. We value the attention as well as the
decisions of the Security Council, which is entrusted
with preserving international security and peace. It is
essential that the Security Council act immediately to
put an end to the Israeli onslaught on Lebanon.
For the people of Lebanon today, as they look
into the future, the stakes could not be higher. That is also
the case, I believe, for the world. Success in bringing
peace and stability to Lebanon is a sign of the ability
and resolve of the international community to assure
the peoples of the world that a just peace can prevail.
The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of Israel.
Mr. Gillerman (Israel): At the outset, I would
like to express my appreciation to the Foreign
Ministers who have honoured us with their presence
here today. I would also like to express my gratitude to
all the members of the Security Council for the long
hours and hard work they have invested in this
endeavour. I would like especially to commend
Ambassadors John Bolton and Jean-Marc de La
Sabli√®re for their determination and commitment.
Today, but for the grace of God and the alertness
of the British security authorities, we could have been
sitting here in the aftermath of a terrorist atrocity
greater even than 9/11. The world would have
mourned, but in the streets of Tehran, Damascus and
parts of Lebanon, there would have been rejoicing, just
as there was after 9/11. Mercifully, the plan was foiled.
But the threat, and the genocidal ideology that inspired
it, remains.
It is that same genocidal ideology, it is that same
fanatical terrorism, that Israel has been confronting in
Lebanon for the past month and that the Security
Council is asked to address today.
For the past month, Israel has been confronting
this vile phenomenon as it expresses itself in our
region. But the threat we have been facing is not
limited to our region; it has set its sights on the world
at large. The terrorists in our region have a gruesome
record of diabolical invention in perpetrating their
atrocities, but these heinous innovations have been
quick to cross borders and continents. Hostage-taking,
suicide-bombings and hijackings know no boundaries,
as many States represented at this table, among them
Argentina, Britain, Greece, Japan, Qatar, Russia and
the United States, know only too well. Not only are the
countries of the West their targets, but also the
moderate regimes in our region, which offer hope of
progress and prosperity and the basic freedoms to
which the terrorists are so fundamentally opposed.
The stakes could not be higher. Yesterday‚Äôs foiled
plot is a wake-up call that the campaign of terror,
motivated by fanatical intent and backed by lethal
weapons of destruction, is not limited to any region,
but threatens the whole world. The tragedy we have
seen in our region over the past weeks, it tells us, is but
a preview of the coming attraction, produced by Iran,
directed by Syria, acted by terrorist groups, soon to be
seen in a theatre near you. Whether we will succeed in
defeating this threat depends, in large part, on the
resolve we demonstrate today.
It is often said, ‚ÄúWhere there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a
way‚Äù. But recent years have demonstrated that where
there is a way, there is not always a will. The way to
avoid the crisis between Israel and Lebanon has been
clear: implementation of the unconditional obligations
set out in resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006),
which set out issues for resolution between Lebanon
and Syria. The clear path forward required the
disarming and disbanding of Hizbollah and other
militias, and the exercise by Lebanon, like any
sovereign State, of control and authority over all its
territory. But the will to implement this way has been
lacking, and over the past month the peoples of Israel
and Lebanon have paid a heavy price for that inaction.
In the face of the failure to ensure that the
obligations set out in those resolutions were
implemented, Israel has had no choice but to do what
Lebanon has failed to do. As a result, Hizbollah‚Äôs lethal
capabilities have been dealt a major blow: bases have
been dismantled and stockpiles of Iranian missiles have
been destroyed. Southern Lebanon has been
substantially cleared of the infrastructure of terrorism,
and the terrorists and their sponsors have learned that a
S/PV.5511
2106-46491
campaign of brutal terrorism will meet with the
forceful response it deserves.
But after six years of inaction which has enabled
Hizbollah to serve foreign interests and to dig itself
deeply into Lebanese soil, there is much yet to be done.
Israel, like any State, has the right and the duty to defend
its citizens from Hizbollah‚Äôs unprovoked attacks, to bring
its captive soldiers home and to continue its efforts to
complete the task of rooting out the terrorists and
removing the threat they present to the Israeli and
Lebanese peoples. However, Israel is ready to respond
to the calls of the Council and to give another chance
to the Government of Lebanon and the international
community to create a new reality on the ground.
The responsibility which this resolution places on
the international community cannot be overstated. The
tragedy of the past month could, and would, have been
avoided if the previous resolutions of the Security
Council had been heeded and their provisions fully
implemented in all their parts. The resolution adopted
today is an opportunity to correct the mistakes of the
past and to create a genuine new reality in our region.
It establishes a binding arms embargo requiring all
States to prevent the supply of arms and weapons to
militias and terrorists in Lebanon. It provides for a
radically different international force with a mandate
and the capability to use all necessary means in order
to create a new situation in Lebanon in which the
borders will be secure, in which Hizbollah will not be
rearmed and south Lebanon will be free of armed
militias and weapons. It sets out arrangements to
ensure that, finally, Lebanese armed forces will deploy
throughout Lebanese territory, including along the Blue
Line. And it calls for the unconditional release of our
boys, Udi Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. I hope that the
Security Council will do all it can to make this happen,
and I urge the Council to do so.
But a resolution alone will not do anything; it
will do nothing. Unless the tools set out in this
resolution are used with resolve and decisiveness, we
will be back at this table ‚Äî if not in a week, then in a
month or a year ‚Äî facing an even greater tragedy. For
then, the terrorists, supplied, no doubt, with even more
lethal weapons by Iran, will be even further
emboldened by yet another demonstration of our lack
of commitment and will.
Today‚Äôs resolution brings to an end weeks of
intensive negotiations. But it is not the end of the task;
indeed, it is only the beginning. We need to seize this
moment and open a new chapter for the region, a
chapter in which moderation is not seen as weakness,
and a hand stretched out in peace is not perceived as
one raised in surrender.
The stakes could not be higher for Lebanon and
Israel, or for the region as a whole. These last few
weeks have given us a chilling glimpse of what our
region could be like if Iran were to succeed in
achieving its goal of adding weapons of mass
destruction to its lethal arsenal. But in two important
resolutions adopted by the Council today and last
month, Iran has been sent a clear message: it cannot
develop weapons to threaten the region on its own
territory, and it cannot fight proxy wars on the territory
of others.
President Ahmadinejad of Iran, from whom
Hizbollah draws its genocidal ideology, has stated his
dogma clearly: ‚ÄúThere is nothing more beautiful, holier
or more eternal than the death of a martyr‚Äù. Today
more than ever, a united and determined response is
required from those who believe that there is nothing
more beautiful, holier or more eternal than a child able
to grow up living in security and peace.
I turn once again to my Lebanese colleague and,
through him, to the Lebanese people. There is no
quarrel between our peoples. We have no greater wish
than to live next to a peaceful and prosperous State of
Lebanon, exercising its independence and sovereign
responsibilities like any other State.
The choice that faces the people of Lebanon is
clear. It is a choice between those who develop
agriculture and make deserts bloom and those who turn
towns into bases of terror and barren land. It is a
choice between those who work to advance medicine
and bring health to body and limb and those who
manufacture only weapons of destruction to tear limb
from body. It is a choice between those who export
innovation and technology and those whose only
export is terror.
A few hours ago the sun set on Beirut, and in a
few hours‚Äô time it will rise over Haifa. This night that
bridges those two bleeding cities is the tale of two
cities, two peoples and two religions. It will end the
Moslem holy day and herald the Jewish sabbath, the
holy day of rest and peace. May the sun rise over a new
day for both our peoples, a day of peace, tolerance and
S/PV.5511
06-4649122
prosperity for our children and generations to come ‚Äî
a sabbath of peace. Shabbat shalom.
The President: There are no further speakers on
my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 9.10 p.m.
