Agenda
Non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
S/PV.6518

The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/257, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina,
China, Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, Lebanon,
Nigeria, Portugal, the Russian Federation, South
Africa, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has thus been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1977 (2011).
I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): Brazil’s affirmative vote for
resolution 1977 (2011) confirms our unequivocal
commitment to the cause of a safer world in which
weapons of mass destruction — nuclear, chemical and
biological — will no longer exist. The possibility that
those weapons could fall into the hands of non-State
actors, especially terrorists, remains a matter of great
concern to the international community. In that regard,
in resolution 1540 (2004) we recognize an important
instrument to prevent non-State actors from acquiring,
developing, trafficking in or using nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons and their means of delivery.
However, restricting our efforts only to fighting
proliferation represents a limited perspective. There is
an urgent need for concrete actions towards effective
disarmament by States possessing those weapons. We
bear in mind President Obama’s commitment to
seeking a nuclear-weapon-free world, which we fully
support (see S/PV.6191). We concur with his vision
that moving towards a safer world requires fulfilling
the grand bargain envisioned in the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which amounts
to countries with nuclear weapons moving towards
disarmament, countries without nuclear weapons not
acquiring them, and all countries being able to access
peaceful nuclear energy.
In that regard, we appreciate the efforts that have
been made within the Security Council to highlight the
significance of disarmament in the resolution that we
have adopted today. The risk of proliferation will be
eradicated only once we achieve a world free of
nuclear weapons.
Brazil believes that a broad approach to the
subject covered by resolution 1540 (2004) that takes
into account the possibility of peaceful uses under
international cooperation is also essential to efforts for
a safer world. It is also important to avoid an approach
that would cast generalized suspicion on the good faith
of countries that develop such peaceful programmes.
Concerning the important role that the group of
experts can play, we commend the inclusion of the idea
of equitable geographical distribution among the
criteria for selecting experts. That responds to the
international community’s legitimate concern over
balance and fair representation. The resolution
determines the official establishment of the group of
experts. The criteria on which the selection of experts
will be based are an important aspect of the continued
legitimacy of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1540 (2004).
The group of experts plays a technical role in
assisting the 1540 Committee. The working methods
and structure of the group will be discussed in the next
few months and recommendations will be issued by
August. While we strongly support an effective and
well-coordinated group of experts, Brazil does not
favour the idea that the group should have a leadership
position on a par with or superseding the authority of
the 1540 Committee.
The 1540 Committee has carried out important
and useful work since 2004. It has kept the Security
Council updated on the implementation of resolution
1540 (2004) and has facilitated the provision of
S/PV.6518
311-30512
assistance to States, at their request. The important
work done by the 1540 Committee will continue in the
coming years. We fully support the Committee and will
continue to do so in the future. Examining the mandate
of the Committee every few years is an important
opportunity for the international community to adjust
its work to an evolving scenario. Some questions may
become less relevant or disappear, while new ones may
emerge. Brazil will continue to take part in the work of
the 1540 Committee in a positive and constructive
manner.
Mr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): India supports
resolution 1977 (2011) extending the mandate of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540
(2004) for a period of 10 years until 25 April 2021.
That extended timeline has been included with a view
to help plan assistance and cooperation programmes
for States requesting such assistance from the 1540
Committee on a long-term and predictable basis.
India has expressed its unwavering commitment
to global efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction (WMDs) and their means of
delivery. India recognizes that the proliferation of
WMDs and their means of delivery is a major
challenge facing the international community. As a
victim of terrorism for over three decades, we are fully
cognizant of the catastrophic dangers that the transfer
of WMDs to non-State actors and terrorists could
entail. Clandestine proliferation networks have led to
insecurity for all and must not be allowed to reappear.
The international community must join hands in
eliminating the risks related to sensitive materials and
technologies falling into the hands of terrorists and
non-State actors. The focus on non-State actors should
in no way diminish State accountability in combating
terrorism and dismantling its support infrastructure and
its linkages with WMDs.
India therefore supported the general objectives
of resolution 1540 (2004). That resolution is in line
with our own General Assembly resolution “Measures
to prevent terrorists from gaining access to weapons of
mass destruction”, adopted by consensus every year
since it was first introduced in 2002.
India has enacted a number of effective laws and
regulations and has put in place institutionalized
administrative mechanisms to prohibit access to
WMDs by terrorists and non-State actors. After the
adoption of resolution 1540 (2004), India took
additional steps to further strengthen its existing
legislative and regulatory mechanism for exercising
control over WMDs and their means of delivery.
The WMD Act was enacted in June 2005. The Act
provides for integrated and overarching legislation on
prohibiting unlawful activities in relation to WMDs,
their delivery systems and related materials, equipment
and technologies. The amendments to the 1992 Foreign
Trade (Development and Regulation) Act passed in
2010 further strengthened our national export control
system. India is committed to maintaining effective
national export controls consistent with the highest
international standards, and is prepared to make its
contribution as a full member of the respective
multilateral export control regimes.
India has fulfilled its obligations under the
Chemical Weapons Convention, including the
destruction of its chemical weapons stockpiles in
advance of the timeline agreed under the Convention.
India is also a State party to the 1972 Biological
Weapons Convention and participates in the activities
under the Convention.
India filed its report on resolution 1540 (2004) in
November 2004, and has submitted periodic updates.
An Indian expert participated in the work of the 1540
Committee between 2007 and 2009. India has also
expressed its readiness to offer assistance to other
countries in capacity-building and in fulfilling their
obligations under resolution 1540 (2004). India has
also participated in activities related to the resolution
such as a workshop on the implementation of
resolution 1540 (2004), held jointly by the United
States of America and Sri Lanka in Colombo in June
2009.
We welcomed President Obama’s initiative in
convening the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington,
D.C., in April 2010. India welcomed the adoption of
the Summit communiqué and the workplan, which
establishes a common platform for all participating
States. We see the Nuclear Security Summit process as
building pragmatic and purposeful frameworks, setting
benchmarks and standards, and fostering confidence
for international cooperation to supplement and not
replace existing multilateral institutions such as the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). India
believes that the primary responsibility for ensuring
nuclear security rests at the national level, but national
responsibility must be accompanied by responsible
S/PV.6518
11-305124
behaviour by States. All States should scrupulously
abide by their international obligations.
Measures for the implementation of the resolution
should be undertaken by States based on their national
practices and processes. Resolution 1540 (2004) has
contributed to greater awareness among States on the
need for effective measures at the national level to
prevent terrorists and non-State actors from gaining
access to sensitive materials and technologies.
Reporting by States of their implementation measures
facilitates the overview of the implementation by the
1540 Committee.
Assistance and cooperation for States requesting
such assistance is a key element of the implementation
process. Such assistance programmes should be suited
to specific national or regional requirements. The 1540
Committee has also established cooperative relations
with several international organizations. Consistent
with their respective mandates, the IAEA and the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
can contribute to the objectives of resolution 1540
(2004). We also feel that the full implementation of the
communiqué and workplan of the Nuclear Security
Summit can also contribute to our common goals.
India remains committed to achieving the
objectives of resolution 1540 (2004). India is also
prepared to render the necessary assistance to States
requesting such assistance in fulfilling their obligations
under the resolution. We hope that the extended
deadline will also encourage the Committee to take its
work forward in a spirit of transparency and
cooperation, so that all Member States feel that they
have a common stake in the successful implementation
of resolution 1540 (2004).
The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 3.25 p.m.
