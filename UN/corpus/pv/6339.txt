The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2010/264)
Report of the Secretary-General on his mission
of good offices in Cyprus (S/2010/238)
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/311, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by China, France, the
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.
I should also like to draw the Council’s attention
to the report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations operation in Cyprus and to the report of the
Secretary-General on his mission of good offices in
Cyprus, which have been issued as documents
S/2010/264 and S/2010/238, respectively.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that the presidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of the
parties, who maintain their well-known positions vis-à-
vis the item on the Council’s agenda. On the basis of
those meetings, with the consent of the members of the
Council, the presidency has drawn the conclusion that
the Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Uganda, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States
of America
Against:
Turkey
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 14
votes in favour and one against. The draft resolution
has been adopted as resolution 1930 (2010).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Apakan (Turkey): Having voted against the
draft resolution today, I would like to briefly share with
the Council the reasons that compelled us to do so.
Turkey’s persistent objection has always been to
the method through which these resolutions have been
adopted and to the language they have contained. Since
the adoption of resolution 186 (1964), which set up the
United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP), all Council resolutions extending the
mandate of the Force are unfortunately still being
formulated as if there were only one side on the island.
We all know that, since 1963, there has not been a
joint and constitutional Government representing the
whole of Cyprus. Considering the Greek Cypriot
Government to be the Government of the whole island
has been the main obstacle in the way to finding a just,
lasting and comprehensive solution for over 46 years.
Therefore, the open consent of the two parties on the
island should have been sought.
We wanted this situation to be corrected in
today’s resolution. Yet, we see once again that that did
not happen.
We welcome the elements concerning the
Secretary-General’s good offices mission contained in
today’s resolution. Despite misquotations, such as that
in the sixth preambular paragraph, where the phrase “if
possible” has been added to the wording of the original
statement made by the two leaders on the island on
21 December 2009, we believe that the resolution still
carries the right messages. Above all, it confirms the
common expectation that 2010 will be the year of a
solution consistent with the hope expressed by the two
leaders and shared by the Secretary-General and most,
if not all, of the international community.
I would like to reaffirm that the Turkish side has
implemented and will continue to implement the
provisions of this and related resolutions. We believe
that achieving a mutually acceptable and
comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem
S/PV.6339
310-40538
within established United Nations parameters, which
will safeguard the fundamental and legitimate rights
and interests of the two peoples on the island, is
possible and within reach. Therefore, Turkey will
continue to fully support the Secretary-General’s
efforts and cooperate with UNFICYP.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Council
has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
