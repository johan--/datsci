The meeting was called to order at 12.30 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Report of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
(S/2004/453)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Sudan, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Hassan
(Sudan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the Sudan,
document S/2004/453. Members of the Council also
have before them document S/2004/473, which
contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: The draft resolution received 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1547 (2004).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
Security Council, in this vote, has demonstrated its
unanimous support for the Naivasha peace process and
for the statesmanlike role carried out by the parties. We
very much look forward to seeing further progress and
to that process coming to a successful conclusion. It is
right that the United Nations should put itself in a
position where it is able to give every support to that
process and to support the Government of the Sudan in
its efforts to bring an end to a conflict that has run for a
very long period.
So, progress, a special political mission and a
readiness to consider a peace support operation are
absolutely right at this stage. But, too, it is right that, in
adopting this resolution, we should look to see similar
progress throughout the Sudan, we should reinforce
again the efforts of the Government of that country,
which is responsible throughout the country for the
well-being of its citizens, and we should pay particular
attention to the situation in Darfur and ensure that all
of us and the humanitarian agencies play our part to
avert any humanitarian catastrophe in that area.
Mr. Trautwein (Germany): Germany welcomes
the United Nations commitment to supporting the
implementation of a future north-south peace
agreement for the Sudan, which is highlighted in the
resolution the Council has just adopted unanimously.
This agreement, when truly implemented, will offer the
possibility of finding an end to this long-lasting
conflict, which has cost so many lives.
While there has been significant progress in the
comprehensive Sudanese peace process, which the text
of this resolution explicitly recognizes, a lasting
peaceful settlement for the whole of the Sudan will be
possible only when all the conflicts in the countries
have been resolved. That includes an end to the
sweeping and widespread human rights violations in
the conflict regions in the Sudan.
The Secretary-General‚Äôs report (S/2004/453),
which the Council expressly welcomed today with the
resolution at hand, clearly refers to that fact. In that
3
S/PV.4988
context, Germany expresses its support for the plan of
action for the protection of human rights in Darfur
presented by the Acting High Commissioner for
Human Rights. We believed that it was indispensable
that this overall context of the conflict should also be
appropriately reflected in the resolution, and we
therefore welcome the reference in the text of the
resolution to the presidential statement of 25 May
(S/PRST/2004/18), which directly addresses the
conflicts in Darfur and in the western Upper Nile. We
call upon the parties to the conflict to meet their
obligations arising from the N‚ÄôDjamena peace
agreement.
Mr. Cunningham (United States of America): I
would just like to draw the attention of Council
members to the statement issued yesterday by the
leaders of the Group of Eight, in which they warmly
welcomed the 26 May signing by the Government of
the Sudan and the Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation
Movement of protocols on power-sharing, on Abyei,
and on the two areas of the Southern Blue Nile and the
Nuba Mountains. They urged the parties to reach a
final and comprehensive agreement that includes a
timetable and security arrangements as quickly as
possible, and hoped that that agreement and its faithful
implementation will end one of the world‚Äôs most
painful conflicts and begin a new era of Sudanese
peace and prosperity.
They also expressed their grave concern over the
humanitarian, human rights and political crisis in
Darfur. They welcomed the N‚ÄôDjamena ceasefire
agreement of 8 April and the announcement on 20 May
by the Government of the Sudan that restrictions on
humanitarian access will be eased. However, there are
continuing reports of gross violations of human rights,
many with an ethnic dimension. They called on parties
to the conflict to immediately and fully respect the
ceasefire, allow unimpeded humanitarian access to all
those in need and create the conditions for the
displaced to return safely to their homes. They called
especially on the Sudanese Government to disarm
immediately the Janjaweed and other armed groups
which are responsible for massive human rights
violations in Darfur. They called on the conflict parties
to address the roots of the Darfur conflict and to seek a
political solution.
They also supported the African Union as it
assumes the leading role in the monitoring mission
which is now being sent to the Darfur region to
supervise the ceasefire agreement. They pledged their
countries‚Äô assistance in ending the conflicts in Sudan
and in providing humanitarian aid to those in need, and
called on all parties to the conflicts in Sudan to commit
themselves to respecting the right of all Sudanese to
live in peace and dignity. They concluded by looking to
the United Nations to lead the international effort to
avert a major disaster and to work together to achieve
that end.
Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My
delegation welcomes the recent conclusion in
Naivasha, Kenya, of the three protocols to agreements
that, along with those reached over the past two years,
now pave the way to a peaceful settlement of the
conflict that has gone on too long in the southern
Sudan.
While we welcome the efforts undertaken by the
parties to the conflict and the regional and international
mediators, which may lead to a restoration of lasting
peace in the southern Sudan following the dashing of
many earlier hopes, my delegation remains aware of
the fragility of the process under way, the challenges
confronting it, and the danger that it may be knocked
off track at any moment. As the Secretary-General very
clearly indicates in his report, the parties to the conflict
and the international community must display
unshakeable will and steadfast resolve if we are to
bring the peace process in the southern Sudan to a
conclusion.
In order to thwart all those who would wish the
process to fail in pursuit of their objectives and to
avoid the various potential obstacles, significant
human, financial and material means must be
mobilized, keeping in mind the geographical, political,
social and economic constraints. Such are the
challenges to the implementation of the agreement
protocols already concluded and of an eventual
comprehensive agreement. At this critical phase,
therefore, my delegation would call for a mobilization
of resources and a focusing of energy to accompany the
peace process in the southern Sudan so as to avert any
possibility of failure.
Without denying the importance of challenges in
other regions in the immense territory of the Sudan,
which also deserve a comparable mobilization effort
and the full attention of the international community
and of the Sudanese parties involved, my delegation
should have liked the resolution to guarantee ongoing
4
S/PV.4988
international mobilization to accompany the peace
process under way in the southern Sudan.
In that spirit, my delegation fully endorses the
Secretary-General‚Äôs recommendations, particularly
those pertaining to the deployment of an advance team,
with the prospect of establishing a United Nations
operation after the conclusion of a comprehensive
peace agreement in the southern Sudan.
Mr. Akram (Pakistan): The civil war that has
afflicted the Sudan for the larger part of its independent
history is most unfortunate. Its consequences have
been severe for the people of the country and for the
region.
Pakistan welcomes the progress made towards a
negotiated and mutually acceptable settlement of the
conflict. We welcome the engagement of the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the
African Union and the international community in
helping the parties move forward towards peace.
Pakistan especially welcomes the commitment of the
United Nations to supporting the peace process.
The main objective of the resolution we have just
adopted is to welcome the recent progress in the
Naivasha process and to enable the deployment of a
United Nations advance team in the Sudan to prepare
for the introduction of a United Nations operation
intended to support the implementation of a
comprehensive peace agreement to be signed by the
parties. The cooperation of the parties is and will
remain vital for the implementation of any peace
agreement. It will be important, therefore, to keep the
Government of the Sudan fully and constructively
engaged in the process.
The resolution refers to the problems in the
Darfur and Upper Nile regions of the Sudan. In Darfur,
there is a humanitarian crisis initiated by an armed
rebellion and escalated by the response. What is
important now is for the international community to
respond generously to this humanitarian crisis. This
response has been disappointing so far. Therefore, we
welcome the reference in the resolution to the need for
extensive funding in support of peace in the Sudan.
The Sudan is an important member of the African
Union, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and
the United Nations. As a United Nations Member
State, the Sudan has all the rights and privileges
incumbent under the United Nations Charter, including
to sovereignty, political independence, unity and
territorial integrity ‚Äî the principles that form the basis
of international relations. Long-term peace and
stability and the unity of the Sudan are in the interests
not only of its own people, but also of the international
community. This should be the central objective of the
Security Council.
Finally, in closing let me say that it should be a
matter of principle that a country concerned in any
issue under discussion by the Security Council or the
subject of a resolution should have the right to
participate and to speak in the Council‚Äôs meetings. We
have extended that right to other countries and we
should not have denied it in this case.
The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 12.45 p.m.
