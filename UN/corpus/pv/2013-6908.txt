Agenda
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations operation in Cyprus
(S/2013/7)
2 13-21577
S/PV.6908
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan): I should like briefly
to share with the Council the reasoning behind our
abstention in the voting on resolution 2089 (2013).
We would like to express our gratitude to the
delegation of the United Kingdom for its leadership and
efforts in facilitating the negotiations on the resolution.
Azerbaijan fully supports the six-month mandate
renewal of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in
Cyprus.
The year 2013 marks the fiftieth since the
emergence of the Cyprus problem. A just and lasting
political settlement without further delay is the hope
and expectation of the international community.
Needless to say, finding a solution as soon as possible
would be in the interests of both sides and of the entire
region. Azerbaijan believes that achieving a settlement
of the Cyprus problem within the established United
Nations parameters is possible, and we reiterate our full
support for the Secretary-General‚Äôs efforts to that end.
It is clear that a settlement can be attained only through
a results-oriented process and continued support to the
Secretary-General‚Äôs good offices mission.
While the resolution had to be a technical roll-over,
it nevertheless contains a number of elements that are
outdated. In fact, the language of resolution 2089 (2013)
in regard to negotiations is repeated from resolution
2058 (2012) without duly reflecting the situation during
the six-month reporting period. Thus, calls throughout
the text to move towards more intensive negotiations
are obsolete, as the substantive talks came to a halt in
July 2012.
Moreover, the resolution just adopted contains
apparent factual inaccuracies, such as the reference in
paragraph 5 to the military areas in the north, which are
no longer an issue. Futhermore, the resolution ignores
a number of concerns raised by the Secretary-General
in his January report (S/2013/7). Except for some minor
amendments, many of the important issues raised by our
delegation based on the aforementioned considerations
were not taken into account during the negotiations.
For the reasons I have just cited, Azerbaijan decided
to abstain in the voting on resolution 2089 (2013).
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2013/7)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2013/48, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by France, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2013/7, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Operation in
Cyprus.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that the presidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of
the parties, who have confirmed that they maintain
their well-known positions vis-√†-vis the item on the
Council‚Äôs agenda. On the basis of those meetings,
with the consent of the members of the Council, the
presidency has drawn the conclusion that the Council
can proceed to take a decision on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Australia, China, France, Guatemala,
Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan, Republic of
Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and United States of America
Abstaining:
Azerbaijan
The President: There were 14 votes in favour, none
against and one abstention. The draft resolution has
been adopted as resolution 2089 (2013).
