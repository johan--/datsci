Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Maintenance of international peace and security
The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Senegal to participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2014/318, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Argentina, Australia, Chad, Chile, France,
Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Nigeria, the Republic
of Korea, the Russian Federation, Rwanda, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Australia, Chad, Chile, China, France,
Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Nigeria, Republic
of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2154 (2014).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein (Jordan): I
would like to begin by addressing these words to the
family of the late Captain Mbaye Diagne.
For 20 years, they have grieved the loss of man
who once served the United Nations — indeed
humankind — with the greatest distinction as a military
observer in the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Rwanda. That he was never to return alive to his
beloved family or to the country he served so well must
have brought immense pain, and that no official from
the United Nations Headquarters here in New York ever
called on his family can only be described as shameful.
While I can only speak for my own delegation, I am
absolutely sure that everyone here will join me when
I say that we are sorry, profoundly sorry, for the way
they have been treated by us here at the United Nations.
We now recognize, what they have always known.
Mbaye was the finest example of what we humans,
our human family, can produce, the very best of what
we are and what we have, and of whom his family and
the people of Senegal must always be very proud. In
this context, I am very pleased to see our colleague
the Permanent Representative of Senegal, Ambassador
Abdou Salam Diallo, with us here this morning.
By adopting resolution 2154 (2014), the Security
Council not only honours the memory of Captain
Mbaye Diagne, but in creating a medal in his name for
exceptional courage, we will for the first time in United
Nations history recognize publicly those who perform
amazing feats in the face of extreme danger on behalf
of the United Nations and humankind. Most especially,
we hope that the medal will inspire those United
Nations and associated personnel who toil in dangerous
situations to continue serving the United Nations
bravely. And for those few who demonstrate the most
breathtaking acts of human courage, this new and rare
medal in the name of Captain Mbaye Diagne, together
with the universal recognition that will come with it,
will represent humankind’s ultimate acknowledgment
of their selfless devotion to the well-being of others.
Finally, Mr. President, I would like to thank you
and all the members of the Security Council for the
enthusiastic commitment and cooperation all of you
have shown in drafting this resolution, in sponsoring
it, and in seeing it adopted this morning by consensus.
Mr. Gasana (Rwanda): On 16 April 2014, the
Security Council adopted resolution 2150 (2014) on
the occasion of the twentieth commemoration of the
genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. The resolution
also commemorates Hutus and others who were killed
because they opposed the genocide. Obviously, Captain
Mbaye Diagne could be categorized among those. But
for us Rwandans, Captain Diagne is more than that. He
is a hero. He was a son of Africa, born in the great nation
of Senegal, which is represented here by His Excellency
Mr. Abdou Salam Diallo, Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, who I salute.
Captain Diagne, as a peacekeeper in the United
Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR),
understood better than anyone else what his mission
was. In the face of evil, he refused to be a bystander.
He chose to become an upstander. He acted as a

To conclude, I sincerely hope that the Captain
Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage will
serve as an opportunity for soul-searching on the part
of the United Nations, which should always ensure that
humanity is collectively preserved by the community of
nations and guided by moral rules and principles rather
than only protected by the courage — I am so sorry, I
must pause, this is emotional for me — of exceptional
individuals like Captain Mbaye Diagne, whose life we
are celebrating today.
The President: I am sure that all of us sympathize
with the emotions expressed by the representative of
Rwanda.
I now give the floor to the representative of Senegal.
Mr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would first
like to bow to tradition in warmly congratulating you,
Sir, on your country’s accession to the presidency of the
Security Council and to assure you of my delegation’s
full cooperation.
I am honoured to take part in this meeting of the
Council, which is convened to pay tribute to a worthy
son of the United Nations — Captain Mbaye Diagne, a
peacekeeper and fallen hero on the field of honour in
Rwanda, with the ideals of the United Nations as his
bible. I would also like to heartily thank His Highness
Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein, Permanent
Representative of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,
who had the happy notion of giving the achievements
of this young officer unprecedented recognition, once
again underscoring his beloved country’s attachment to
the cause of peace and justice around the world.
I am pleased to be able to extend my gratitude to
all the members of the Council that sponsored today’s
resolution 2154 (2014) in a sign of the unanimous drive
supporting the resolve of the international community,
through Mbaye Diagne, to re-establish the protection
of civilians at the centre of its priority concerns. The
resolution, which dedicates an eponymous medal to
his exceptional courage, is irrefutable proof of the
Security Council’s commitment to recognizing the
many sacrifices made by thousands of Blue Helmets in
theatres of operations.
Born on 18 March 1958, Captain Mbaye Diagne,
who was married with two children, began his service
in the Senegalese army on 15 January 1983, rising to
the rank of captain on 1 April 1991. His last assignment
within the Senegalese armed forces was as Unit
Commander of the 6th Infantry Battalion. In saving
peacekeeper. He acted as a solider. He acted as a human
to save lives, even against the UNAMIR mandate,
against the rule of engagement and against instructions
from New York. With no guns, no weapons, armed only
with courage and a sense of responsibility, Captain
Diagne decided to conduct several missions, passing
through dozens of checkpoints held by armed militias
to save hundreds, perhaps thousands of Rwandans
during the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.
For his courage and bravery, Captain Mbaye
Diagne was, on 4 July 2010, posthumously awarded
the Umurinzi medal by the Government of Rwanda,
together with 11 other exceptional men who contributed
to the campaign against the genocide in Rwanda. I am
convinced that his wife Yacine, his daughter Coumba
and his son Cheikh will always be proud of him, just as
we Rwandans and we nations of the world will always
be proud of his service to humanity.
It is in this context that we particularly thank His
Royal Highness Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein
and the Jordanian mission for submitting resolution
2154 (2014), which was adopted unanimously today
and created the Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for
Exceptional Courage, to be awarded to those military,
police, civilian United Nations personnel and associated
personnel who, in the future, will demonstrate similar
courage while fulfilling the mandate of their missions
or their functions in the service of humanity.
We believe that this medal is not only a recognition
of the courage of the man, but also a reminder of what
a soldier and a peacekeeper should be — a woman or
a man dedicated to promoting peace, to saving lives
against all odds and to obeying the most important
rule, the protection of the vulnerable. Let us hope that
this medal will encourage the Security Council, the
Secretariat and peacekeepers to better promote the
protection of civilians and the responsibility to protect.
While celebrating the exceptional courage of
Captain Mbaye Diagne, we also remember the heroic
acts of ordinary Rwandans, many of whom paid the
ultimate sacrifice to protect the Tutsi and oppose the
genocide, which took the lives of more than one million
Rwandans in 100 days. We also pay tribute to other blue
helmets who were killed during the genocide against the
Tutsi in Rwanda, including the 10 Belgian peacekeepers
who were killed while protecting the former Prime
Minister, the late Agathe Uwilingiyimana. To their
families, we offer prayers and solace. Rwandans will
always be grateful.

behalf of the Department of State of the United States,
as well as by the Garden of the Righteous of the World
of Padua for distinguishing himself with bravery for
such a noble cause.
World peace requires rejection and enmity to yield
forever to acceptance and dialogue with one another.
It implies that the commitment of United Nations
forces be permanently rooted in the universal values
that we have chosen and inscribed in letters of gold in
the Charter of the United Nations. That is the essence
of the virtue that is so eloquently expressed in today’s
resolution.
I am happy to conclude by taking this opportunity
to reaffirm my country’s commitment, and in
particular the commitment of its armed forces, to the
ideals that unite the community of nations gathered in
within this Headquarters of world peace. To Captain
Mbaye Diagne, to whom I express the gratitude of the
Senegalese nation, I say, rest in peace in the land of
the heroes of the United Nations, which will forever
enshrine you in posterity.
The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
the lives of hundreds of people, as his conscience
dictated, Captain Diagne embodied the motto of the
National School for Active Officers, where he was
trained — “Intelligence, honour, bravery” — the virtues
that underpin the Senegalese army. In Senegal, he has
thus been posthumously raised to the rank of Chevalier
of the National Order of the Lion and awarded the
Military Cross with silver star, as well as being chosen
as godfather to the 13th class of the National School of
Active Officers, who graduated in 1995. We will keep
the memory of this brave officer in our hearts forever,
in piety and gratitude.
This is also the time to salute the many honours that
the late Captain Diagne has received. From Dakar to
Kigali, from Washington, D.C., to Padua, worthy men,
women and institutions have paid tribute to him. In that
regard, he will be receiving the Umurinzi award, which
recognizes heroes of the Rwandan genocide, from
President Paul Kagame, whom I would like to thank,
and through him the friendly and fraternal people of
Rwanda for the honourable treatment they have always
shown to the family of Mbaye Diagne. Just now I was
gripped by the emotion shared by my friend and brother
the Permanent Representative of Rwanda, Ambassador
Eugène-Richard Gasana. Captain Diagne was also
honoured by, among others, Mrs. Hillary Clinton on
