The President: I should like to inform the

Permanent Representative of Liberia, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate

Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Barnes

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
