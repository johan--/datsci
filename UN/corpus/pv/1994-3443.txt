Agenda
Date of an election to fill a vacancy in the International Court of Justice (S/1994/1188)
Security Council 3443rd meeting
Forty-ninth year 21 October 1994
The meeting was called to order at 11.30 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Date of an election to fill a vacancy in the International
Court of Justice (S/1994/1188)
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/1994/1188, which contains a note dated 20 October 1994
by the Secretary-General concerning the date of an election
to fill a vacancy in the International Court of Justice. This
note explains the need for this item on our agenda.
The recent death, on 28 September 1994, of Judge
Nikolai Konstantinovitch Tarassov has created a vacancy in
the International Court of Justice which has to be filled.
Judge Tarassov, a member of the International Court of
Justice, had a long and distinguished career in the service
of the Court and of his country in the field of international
law and diplomacy. He represented the former USSR in
numerous United Nations bodies. From 1968 to 1972, he
was a member of the Commission on Human Rights and
the Committee for Sanctions against Southern Rhodesia.
He was also a member of the USSR delegation to
numerous sessions of the General Assembly, including the
fifth special session on South-West Africa, in 1967, and the
fifth emergency special session on the Arab-Israeli conflict,
in 1967.
In his personal capacity, he served with distinction as
a member of the Committee for the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination, as well as of the International Civil Service
Advisory Board from 1970 to 1972. Judge Tarassov was
also head of the USSR delegation to the Vienna talks on
mutual reductions of force and armaments in Central
Europe from 1976 to 1981. He was a distinguished
member of the Russian International Law Association.
Judge Tarassov was indeed a most distinguished
international lawyer and jurist, and an eminent judge. His
loss has been deeply felt by the Government and people
of the Russian Federation, by the International Court of
Justice and by the international community as a whole.
I am sure that I am expressing the sentiments of all
members of the Council in extending sincere condolences
to the President of the Court, to the Government of the
Russian Federation and to the bereaved family of Judge
Nikolai Konstantinovitch Tarassov.
Judge Tarassov was elected as a member of the
International Court of Justice on 9 December 1985. He
was re-elected as of 6 February 1988 for a further period
of nine years. His term of office would have expired on
5 February 1997.
Under Article 14 of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice, the Security Council is to fix the date
for the election to fill the vacancy in the Court.
As I reported to members during our prior
consultations on this matter, the election should take place
on 26 January 1995 at a meeting of the Security Council,
and at a meeting of the General Assembly at its forty-
ninth session.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/1994/1189, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs consultations.
May I take it that the Council is ready to proceed to a
decision on the draft resolution?
There being no objection, it is so decided.
In the light of the consultations which I have held,
it is my understanding that the Council is ready to adopt
the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1189
without a vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution
951 (1994).
The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.35 a.m.
