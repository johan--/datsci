The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
The President: I should like to inform the

representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The

draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
