The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Liberia, in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council’s agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Bull (Liberia)
took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
twentieth progress report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, document

them document S/1996/984, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/1996/984) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
