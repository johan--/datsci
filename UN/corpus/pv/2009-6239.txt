The meeting was called to order at 11.05 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations operation in Cyprus
(S/2009/609)
Report of the Secretary-General on his mission
of good offices in Cyprus (S/2009/610)
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/641, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by China, France, the
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States
America.
I should also like to draw the attention of
participants to the report of the Secretary-General on
the United Nations operation in Cyprus, which has
been issued as document S/2009/609, and to the report
of the Secretary-General on his mission of good offices
in Cyprus, which has been issued as document
S/2009/610.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that the presidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of the
parties, who maintain their well-known positions
vis-√†-vis the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. On the
basis of those meetings, with the consent of the
members of the Council, the presidency has drawn the
conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision of the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear
any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America, Viet Nam
Against:
Turkey
The President (spoke in French): There were
14 votes in favour and one against. The draft resolution
has been adopted as resolution 1898 (2009).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Apakan (Turkey): Having voted against
today‚Äôs resolution, I would like briefly to share with
the Council the reasons that compelled us to do so.
Turkey has never objected to the intention behind
the establishment of the United Nations Peacekeeping
Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) back in 1964, which was
to protect Turkish Cypriots. Our objections have
always been to the method through which resolutions
such as today‚Äôs have been adopted and the language
they contain. Resolution 186 (1964), which set up the
United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, and
subsequent resolutions extending the mandate of the
Force have all made references to the Government of
Cyprus.
As all members know, the partnership State
established by the 1959 London and Zurich
Agreements in the shape of the Republic of Cyprus and
the Government of Cyprus, collapsed in 1963, when
Turkish Cypriots were expelled from all State
institutions, including the Government. Since that day,
there has not been a joint constitutional Government
representing all of Cyprus, either legally or
functionally, and the two peoples have been living
separately under their own administrations. Actually,
this wrong approach of considering the Government of
Cyprus as the Government of the whole island has been
the main obstacle in the way to finding a just, lasting
and comprehensive solution for over 45 years.
The spirit of goodwill and cooperation displayed
by the Turkish Cypriot side, which enabled UNFICYP
to function in the northern part of the island in
accordance with the modalities set by the Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, does not change the fact
that the open consent of the two sides has to be sought
for the extension of the mandate of UNFICYP.
However, today‚Äôs resolution once again fails to do so.
S/PV.6239
309-64656
In line with the provisions on contingency
planning in resolution 1873 (2009) and the intention to
keep all peacekeeping operations, including UNFICYP,
under review, the Secretary-General says in his report
(S/2009/609) that the two sides will decide what role
UNFICYP will play in the future. If the Turkish
Cypriot side has a say in the future of UNFICYP, why
is its consent not sought today? That looks like a
paradox.
The resolution adopted today also contained
elements dealing with the good offices mission of the
Secretary-General but unfortunately fails to make any
reference to resolution 1250 (1999), which lies at the
source of this mission. Turkey fully supports the
Secretary-General‚Äôs good offices mission. We welcome
the solid progress achieved so far in the negotiations,
which aim at establishing a partnership State on the
basis of well-established United Nations parameters,
namely bi-zonality, political equality and equal status
of two co-founder peoples. As the two leaders agreed
on 23 May 2008, this new partnership will have a
federal Government and two constituent States with
equal status.
In that regard, we would like to put on record our
full support to the efforts of the Special Adviser of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Alexander Downer, and his
team.
The President (spoke in French): The Council
has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.10 a.m.
