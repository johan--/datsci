The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Côte d’Ivoire
Second report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Mission in Côte d’Ivoire
(S/2003/1069)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Côte d’Ivoire in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Djangone-Bi
(Côte d’Ivoire) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will
continue its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
second report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Mission in Côte d’Ivoire (S/2003/1069).
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2003/1083, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America.
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1514 (2003).
Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:
“The Security Council urges all Ivorian
political forces to implement fully, without delay
or precondition all the provisions of the Linas-
Marcoussis Agreement as well as those of the
agreement reached in Accra on 8 March 2003
(‘Accra II’) with a view to open, free and
transparent elections being held in Côte d’Ivoire
in 2005.
“The Security Council notes with
satisfaction the progress made since the statement
by its President on 25 July, in particular the
appointment of Ministers of Interior and Defence,
the adoption of the amnesty bill by the National
Assembly, the reopening of the border with Mali
and Burkina Faso, and the decisions taken by the
Council of Ministers on 16 October to restore
public order and reform the statute of Ivorian
radio and television (RTI).
“The Security Council expresses its serious
concern, however, that the implementation of the
Linas-Marcoussis Agreement has slowed down. It
emphasizes in particular the importance of the
entire Government of National Reconciliation
meeting as soon as possible in order to implement
fully the content of the Linas-Marcoussis
Agreement. It reaffirms in this context the
urgency of carrying out the cantonment
operations of the forces involved, to allow the
beginning of disarmament and demobilization,
accompanied by measures for reintegration into
the regular army or civilian life.
“The Security Council further emphasizes
the urgent need to begin reforming land law and
electoral rules, restore public services and the
authority of the State throughout the territory of
3
S/PV.4857
Côte d’Ivoire, and end the use of mercenaries and
the illicit purchase of weapons in violation of
national laws.
“The Security Council condemns firmly the
grave human rights violations. It further
condemns the murder of a French journalist on 21
October in Abidjan. The Security Council calls
for a full investigation by the Ivorian authorities
of this crime and punishment of the perpetrators
in accordance with the law. It also calls on them
to ensure that organs of the press and groups
which sponsor them refrain from encouraging any
remark that might incite hatred or violence.
“The Security Council expresses its concern
for the grave humanitarian situation in the field.
In this context, the Council supports the activities
of all United Nations agencies aimed at assisting
the Ivorian people.
“The Security Council further condemns the
hostile acts against United Nations personnel in
Bouaké and Man on 24 and 25 October last, and
recalls that all the parties are obliged, by
resolution 1479 (2003), to cooperate with the
special political mission established by the
Security Council, the United Nations Mission in
Côte d’Ivoire (MINUCI), and to ensure freedom
of movement of its personnel.
“The Security Council reiterates its full
support for the efforts of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS),
France and the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General with a view to stabilizing the
country and seeking a peaceful settlement of the
conflict. The Council welcomes in particular the
recent initiatives of the Presidents of Ghana and
Nigeria and the holding of a regional summit in
Accra on 11 November 2003 to address security
problems in the region.
“The Security Council commends the action
of the forces of ECOWAS and France, and that of
MINUCI, and pays tribute to the commitment and
dedication shown by their personnel. It also
welcomes the efforts of the United Nations Office
for West Africa and of all United Nations
missions in the region to coordinate their action
in order to address regional issues in an
appropriate manner. It expresses its intention to
examine the recommendations by the Secretary-
General on ways to facilitate peace and stability
in Côte d’Ivoire.”
This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2003/20.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
