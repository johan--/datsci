The President (interpretation from Russian): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany
and Italy, in which they request to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council’s agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mrs.
Kalajdzisalihovic´ (Bosnia and Herzegovina) took a
seat at the Council table; Mr. Küntzle (Germany) and
Mr. Fulci (Italy) took the seats reserved for them at
the side of the Council Chamber.
The President (interpretation from Russian): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

document S/1998/648, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Portugal, the Russian Federation, Sweden, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
