The meeting was called to order at 10.40 a.m.
Expression of thanks to the retiring President
Farewell to the Permanent Representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic
The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of September, may I
begin by paying a particular tribute on behalf of all of
us to His Excellency Ambassador Mikhail Wehbe,
Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic
to the United Nations, for his very distinguished and
very important service as President of the Council in
the month of August. I am sure I speak for all of us in
expressing our appreciation of the role which
Ambassador Wehbe and Ambassador Mekdad both
carried out.
In particular, I would like to express every best
wish to Ambassador Wehbe, who after a long period of
service to his country at the United Nations in New
York, is now going to move on to another part of the
United Nations family. We have no doubt that he will
continue to carry on his work with the same distinction
in Geneva as he has done in New York. We wish him
every success and the best of luck in that appointment.
Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in
Arabic): I would not have wanted to intervene at this
point in the meeting, but since this will be the last
Council meeting I shall attend, I would like, Sir, at this
very first meeting of your presidency to begin by
congratulating you. I am confident that you will lead
the Council‚Äôs deliberations this month with your well-
known wisdom and diplomatic expertise. We know that
you will lead the Council to success. This month is full
of events, notably a meeting at the level of Foreign
Ministers, who will be here in New York for the
opening of the fifty-eighth session of the General
Assembly.
I would like to thank you wholeheartedly, Sir, for
the kind words you addressed to me. I also take this
occasion to thank all the Permanent Representatives on
the Security Council, and the members of their
delegations, for the cooperation and assistance they
extended to me, as well as for the coordination they all
undertook to ensure international peace and security. I
wish each and every one of them success in their
endeavours.
