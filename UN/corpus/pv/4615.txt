The situation in Sierra Leone
Fifteenth report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (S/2002/987)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Sierra Leone in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kamara
(Sierra Leone) took the seat reserved for him at
the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2002/987, which contains the text of the
fifteenth report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Mission in Sierra Leone.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2002/1062, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. If I hear no
objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote
now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
