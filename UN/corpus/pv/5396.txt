The meeting was called to order at 6.20 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
Monthly report of the Secretary-General on
Darfur (S/2006/148)
Report of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
(S/2006/160)
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/148, containing the monthly report of
the Secretary-General on Darfur, and document
S/2006/160, containing the report of the Secretary-
General on the Sudan.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/179, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
I should like to draw attention to two revisions to
the draft resolution. In operative paragraph 4, the
phrase beginning in the second part of the fourth line
of the English text should read “expedite the necessary
preparatory planning for transition of AMIS to a
United Nations operation”. The third line of operative
paragraph 6 of the English text should read “support
AMIS during transition to a United Nations operation”.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it (S/2006/179), as orally revised. If I hear no
objection, I shall now put the draft resolution, as orally
revised, to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution, as orally revised,
has been adopted unanimously as resolution 1663
(2006).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.
