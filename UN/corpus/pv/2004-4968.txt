Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Timor-Leste
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Mission of Support in East Timor
(S/2004/333)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Timor-Leste, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Guterres
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2004/333, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission of
Support in East Timor.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2004/383, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines, Romania,
Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1543 (2004).
Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): I would like stress my
delegation‚Äôs appreciation for the consensus adoption of
the resolution extending the mandate of the United
Nations Mission of Support in East Timor, in line with
the presentation of a presidential text.
The delegations of Brazil and Angola were proud
to have had the opportunity to draft the present
resolution, which guarantees the presence of the United
Nations peacekeeping force in Timor-Leste for another
six months with a view to extending its mandate for a
further six months. We are particularly glad that the
international community, through the Security Council,
could provide an adequate answer to the request of the
Timorese authorities.
More than that, the resolution adopted is a clear
commitment of the international community to peace
and security in a country that is only two years of age
and that can take pride for so many historic deeds. We
praise the people and authorities of Timor-Leste for
their tremendous achievements in so short a period of
time. We also praise the international community for
its great support for the building of this new nation. We
are sure that this one-year consolidation phase of the
United Nations presence in Timor-Leste will be of the
utmost importance to the development of Timor-Leste,
its own capabilities and self-sufficiency.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank
all delegations for their valuable contributions during
the negotiations that ended with a rewarding consensus
on the adoption of this resolution. Strong support was
always displayed for the efforts undertaken by the
Timorese Government and people with a view to
bringing peace and prosperity to that country.
Finally, I would like to thank once again
Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma for his outstanding
work in Timor-Leste. We wish him all the best now
that he is concluding his term as Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for East Timor

and returning home for what we hope will be many
good years of happiness with his family and friends.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
