The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Expression of welcome to the new Permanent
Representative of Turkey to the United Nations
The President: At the outset of the meeting I
should like to extend, on behalf of the Council, a warm
welcome to the new Permanent Representative of
Turkey to the United Nations, His Excellency
Mr. Ertuƒürul Apakan. We look forward to working
closely with him.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Letter dated 6 August 2009 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the
Security Council (S/2009/407)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Belgium, Israel, Italy, Lebanon and
Spain, in which they request to be invited to participate
in the consideration of the item on the Council‚Äôs
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite
those representatives to participate in the consideration
of the item, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Salam
(Lebanon) and Ms. Shalev (Israel) took seats at
the Council table; the representatives of the other
aforementioned countries took the seats reserved
for them at the side of the Council Chamber.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/431, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, Croatia, France,
Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America. I
wish to draw the attention of participants to documents
S/2009/330 and S/2009/407, containing the tenth report
of the Secretary-General on Security Council
resolution 1701 (2006) and a letter dated 6 August
2009 from the Secretary-General, respectively.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1884 (2009).
I now give the floor to the representative of
Israel.
Ms. Shalev (Israel): At the outset, allow me to
congratulate you, Mr. President, on your stewardship
of the Council during the month of August.
Israel welcomes the adoption by the Security
Council of resolution 1884 (2009) and the renewal of
the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) for another year. That peacekeeping
mission plays an important role in the implementation
of resolution 1701 (2006). Israel commends UNIFIL on
the fulfilment of its mandate in a challenging and
difficult environment.
The situation in southern Lebanon remains
complex. The events of the past July shed light upon a
dangerous phenomenon about which Israel has been
warning. A terrorist organization, Hizbullah, continues
to deploy its assets and operates actively both north
and south of the Litani River in clear violation of
resolution 1701 (2006) and other relevant Security
Council resolutions.
The region has recently witnessed serious
incidents, in which multiple explosions occurred in
Khirbat Salim, in southern Lebanon, on 14 July. The
Secretary-General, in his letter of 6 August to the
President of the Security Council, duly noted that the
explosions were caused by ‚Äúa large quantity of
S/PV.6183
309-49586
weapons and ammunition‚Äù in an arms cache that was
‚Äúactively maintained‚Äù (S/2009/407, pp. 1-2). As I
understand it, the same was reported by officials of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) in
their briefings to the Council.
The Secretary-General further noted the presence
of individuals belonging to Hizbullah in the vicinity of
Khirbat Salim. In his own words, the Secretary-
General wrote unequivocally that ‚ÄúThis presence of
unauthorized assets or weapons between the Blue Line
and the Litani River constitutes a clear violation of
Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)‚Äù (Ibid., p. 2).
The following days witnessed further violations of
resolution 1701 (2006), with the obstruction of the
freedom of movement of UNIFIL and breaches of the
Blue Line by Hizbullah and its supporters.
Those additional incidents are clear evidence of
the active presence of Hizbullah, a terrorist
organization, in southern Lebanon. This, along with the
ongoing supply of arms across the penetrable Syrian-
Lebanese border, constitutes an increasing threat to
peace and stability in the region.
In the light of the July incidents, the renewal of
the mandate of UNIFIL is an excellent opportunity for
the Security Council and DPKO to further encourage
UNIFIL to strengthen its good work. Such increased
efforts should help ensure that the area between the
Blue Line and the Litani River is ‚Äúan area free of any
armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those
of the Government of Lebanon and of UNIFIL‚Äù
(resolution 1701 (2006), para. 8).
In conclusion, I wish to extend Israel‚Äôs
appreciation to the countries contributing troops to
UNIFIL; to the Force Commander, General Graziano;
to his officers and staff; and to the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations. They all play an important
role in an increasingly challenging and difficult
environment, and Israel commends their dedication.
Israel remains committed to the full
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and looks
forward to cooperating with the Security Council, with
the Secretary-General, with DPKO and with UNIFIL in
that regard.
The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of Lebanon.
Mr. Salam (Lebanon): Allow me at the outset,
Mr. President, to recognize your effective stewardship
of the Security Council during the present month. I
would also like to acknowledge the leadership shown
by your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of
Uganda, as President of the Council in July.
In a few days it will be the third anniversary of
the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701
(2006). In these three years the Lebanese Government
has reiterated time and again its commitment to the
implementation of that resolution in its entirety and to
working closely with the United Nations Interim Force
in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
Today, my Government would like, first and
foremost, to thank all members of the Security Council
for their decision to renew UNIFIL‚Äôs mandate for a
further year, without amendment to its mission, its
rules of engagement or its concept of operations, as per
the request of my Government. I am sure that members
realize how important today‚Äôs decision is for all
Lebanese, who have been the victims of repeated
Israeli aggression since the 1978 invasion, which led to
Security Council 425 (1978) and the creation of the
first UNIFIL.
Allow me also to take this opportunity to praise
UNIFIL for its remarkable work in close coordination
and cooperation with the Lebanese army, to commend
the wise leadership of General Graziano, the Force
Commander, and to thank all troop-contributing
countries as well as the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations.
Three years after the adoption of resolution 1701
(2006), however, we need to acknowledge the fact that
the resolution has still not been fully implemented.
That is not only because Israel continues to breach the
Blue Line and to violate Lebanese airspace on a daily
basis, as stated by the Secretary-General in his latest
report on the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006)
(S/2009/330); it is also because Israel continues to
refuse to withdraw from the northern part of al-Ghajar,
and because a solution has not yet been found to the
issue of the Sheba‚Äôa farms and the Kafr Shuba hills,
even on an interim basis, as earlier proposed by the
Lebanese Government. And how can I not mention in
this context the operations of Israeli spy networks,
about which the Council was briefed by Mr. Michael
Williams on 8 July: do they not constitute a serious
violation of Lebanon‚Äôs sovereignty and consequently
contribute to undermining Security Council resolution
1701 (2006)?
S/PV.6183
09-495864
Given all those indisputable facts, I am sure that
Council members have no doubt about the identity of
the party which must be held responsible for
obstructing the full implementation of resolution 1701
(2006). More disturbing, however, is the fact that
Israeli officials have recently been launching a series
of alarming threats against Lebanon, which raise
serious concerns about Israeli intentions. It is enough
to mention here the words of Israel‚Äôs Defence Minister,
Ehud Barak, who said on 7 August 2009 that ‚ÄúIsrael
did not strike at Lebanon‚Äôs infrastructure hard enough
during the summer war of 2006‚Äù ‚Äî I stress ‚ÄúLebanon‚Äôs
infrastructure‚Äù and ‚Äúdid not strike ... hard enough‚Äù ‚Äî
and who emphasized that a future attack would have
even more destructive effects on Lebanese
infrastructure than the July 2006 war.
Do I need to remind members of the Council that,
during its 2006 war on Lebanon ‚Äî over and above the
thousands of civilian casualties and the hundreds of
thousands of displaced persons ‚Äî as far as
infrastructure is concerned, Israel destroyed 91 bridges
and damaged 137 roads, five airport runways,
58 telephone exchanges and dozens of transmission
centres, and 1,514 water network points and dozens of
reservoirs and pumps ‚Äî in addition to 929 schools,
which were totally or partially destroyed or damaged?
That is not to mention the bombing of the fuel oil tanks
at our geothermal station, which led to the release of
more than 15,000 tons of fuel oil into the
Mediterranean Sea, causing the physical and chemical
contamination of the Lebanese coastline, with serious
implications for human health, biodiversity, fisheries
and the economy of Lebanon.
What Mr. Barak is promising us is only more acts
of that kind: acts which not only are in violation of the
letter and the spirit of resolution 1701 (2006) but run
counter to the fundamental principles of the Charter of
the United Nations, let alone the rules and principles of
international humanitarian law. The credibility of the
Security Council requires that such threats against my
country also be condemned in the strongest words.
The President: There are no further speakers on
my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
