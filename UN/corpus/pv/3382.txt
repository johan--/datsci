Security Council 3382nd meeting
Forty-ninth year 26 May 1994
The meeting was called to order at 12.35 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Disengagement Observer Force
(S/1994/587)
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force, document S/1994/587 and
Corr.l.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1994/620, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Djibouti,
France, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Rwanda, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 921 (1994).
In connection with the resolution just adopted on the
renewal of the mandate of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force, I have been authorized to
make the following complementary statement on behalf of
the Security Council:
"As is known, the report of the Secretary-General on
the United Nations Disengagement Force (S/1994/587)
states in paragraph 20:
’Despite the present quiet in the Israel-
Syria sector, the situation continues to be
potentially dangerous and is likely to remain
so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement
covering all aspects of the Middle East
problem can be reached.’
"That statement of the Secretary-General
reflects the view of the Security Council."
This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1994/27.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.
The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.
