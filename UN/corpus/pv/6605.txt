The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Letter dated 5 August 2011 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the President
of the Security Council (S/2011/488)
The President: Under rule 37 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representatives of Israel, Italy and Spain to participate
in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/545, containing the text of a draft
resolution submitted by France, Germany, Italy, Spain
and the United States of America.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2011/488, containing a letter dated
5 August 2011 from the Secretary-General addressed to
the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by a show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2004 (2011).
I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Salam (Lebanon): I would like to take this
opportunity to express our deep appreciation for the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),
and its leadership and members, women and men, for
their dedication and services. Lebanon commends the
efforts and sacrifices of the UNIFIL forces operating in
southern Lebanon and expresses its appreciation to all
troop-contributing countries, many of which are
represented around this table, including the presidency.
It attaches great importance to strengthening
coordination and cooperation with UNIFIL in
accordance with the agreed rules of engagement in
order to ensure the proper implementation of the
mission entrusted to it. Lebanon would also like to
reiterate its commitment to the implementation of
resolution 1701 (2006) in its entirety.
The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of Israel.
Mr. Waxman (Israel): Allow me, Mr. President,
to commend you for your able stewardship of the
Security Council this month.
I would like to begin by offering Israel’s
condolences to all those affected by the appalling
attacks on United Nations Headquarters in Abuja,
Nigeria, last week.
Israel welcomes the adoption of resolution 2004
(2011) and the renewal of the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). UNIFIL
plays a vital role in promoting stability in our region. I
would like to convey Israel’s appreciation to the
UNIFIL troops, their commanders, the troop-
contributing countries and the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations. Israel is committed to
cooperating with the United Nations to ensure the full
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006).
Yet, as we convene here today, serious threats to
peace and security in Lebanon stand in the way of the
full implementation of that resolution. I would like to
highlight four of those challenges this afternoon.
First, Hizbullah continues to rapidly build up its
arsenal of advanced weaponry and expand its military
presence throughout Lebanon, including south of the
Litani River. Tens of thousands of sophisticated
missiles and rockets are now in the hands of that
terrorist organization. Its growing arsenal places the
majority of Israeli civilians under the spectre of attack.
Hizbullah seeks to acquire even more advanced
weapons through joint and coordinated transfers of
illegal arms supplied by Iran and directly facilitated by
Syria across the Syrian-Lebanese border. The United
Nations and others in the international community are
aware of the scope and magnitude of those transfers.
Yet the existing arms embargo has not been enforced
S/PV.6605
311-48376
and there has been a lack of progress in the
disarmament and disbandment of Hizbullah and other
militias, as mandated by Security Council resolutions.
Israel views this stagnation with great concern.
Israel’s second issue of concern relates to the
cynical Hizbullah tactics that use Lebanese civilians to
further their terrorist activity targeting Israeli civilians.
Since the deployment of UNIFIL forces in 2006,
Hezbollah’s modus operandi has shifted towards
intentionally embedding its military infrastructure
within civilian villages and residential areas. These
developments are occurring in UNIFIL’s area of
operations and throughout other densely populated
areas of Lebanon. Hizbullah terrorist bases, firing
positions and missile storage centres are located
adjacent to — and sometimes within — schools,
hospitals, homes and mosques.
Such exploitation of civilians as human shields
stands in grave violation of international law. On
numerous occasions, Israel has provided the
international community with detailed information
about these violations, yet they continue. More
concerted efforts must be made to fully implement
paragraph 8 of resolution 2004 (2011), just adopted,
which calls on all States to
“fully support and respect the establishment
between the Blue Line and the Litani River of an
area free of any armed personnel, assets and
weapons other than those of the Government of
Lebanon and UNIFIL”.
The Lebanese authorities bear particular responsibility
for putting an end to these serial violations of
resolution 1701 (2006).
Thirdly, Israel remains concerned by the violence
directed at UNIFIL and Hizbullah’s continued attempts
to obstruct the movement and work of the force. From
the periodic reports on the implementation of
resolution 1701 (2006), it is clear that Hizbullah has
long used so-called civilians to impede UNIFIL’s
ability to operate. It employs a range of tactics,
including throwing stones, threatening the Force with
weapons and confiscating equipment. The recent
terrorist attacks against UNIFIL on 27 May and 26 July
marked a serious escalation of the violence directed at
the Force and should be taken very seriously.
The United Nations and the international
community cannot stand by as Hizbullah continues to
obstruct UNIFIL’s work. While Hizbullah’s
fingerprints are all over these clear obstructions, its
name is hardly ever mentioned in United Nations
reports. The international community must also ensure
that the Force has the tools and soldiers necessary to
carry out its mandate effectively.
Finally, despite its obligations under resolution
1701 (2006), the Government of Lebanon continues to
take provocative actions along the Blue Line. On
1 August, a soldier from the Lebanese Armed Forces
(LAF) fired on Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) situated
south of the Blue Line. This was not an isolated
incident, and it was only by chance that the event did
not result in casualties. Let me remind the Council that
on 3 August 2010, in a similar incident, the LAF shot
and killed reservist IDF Battalion Commander
Lieutenant Colonel Dov Harari.
We expect the Government of Lebanon to prevent
such incidents from occurring in the future. The
international community must also take action to
prevent further provocations and convey a clear
message to Lebanon that such attacks carry serious
potential for escalation. In that respect, Israel
welcomes the renewed calls in today’s resolution on all
parties to respect the Blue Line in its entirety, and will
continue to work with UNIFIL to visibly mark the Blue
Line in its entirety. These efforts are integral to
ensuring regional stability, and we call on Lebanon to
uphold its clear international obligations in this regard.
The presence of UNIFIL in southern Lebanon
serves an indispensable role in advancing stability in
our area. In conclusion, I wish to reiterate our support
for today’s resolution, to extend our deep appreciation
to all troop-contributing countries, and to emphasize
our sincere gratitude to the men and women of
UNIFIL, who are performing a difficult task in a
difficult environment to promote peace and security for
all in our region.
The President: The representative of Lebanon
has asked for the floor to make a further statement. I
give him the floor.
Mr. Salam (Lebanon): Five years after the
adoption of resolution 1701 (2006), the Lebanese
Government, as I just said, remains committed to the
full implementation of said resolution in its entirety
and calls upon the United Nations to put an end to
Israeli violations and threats to Lebanon’s sovereignty
in order to allow the implementation of the resolution
S/PV.6605
11-483764
and to move from the precarious situation of a
cessation of hostilities to a permanent ceasefire. This
commitment was reiterated by the Prime Minister of
Lebanon during his visit to southern Lebanon on
16 July.
We believe that the objective and terms of
resolution 1701 (2006) are constantly undermined by
Israel’s every violation of our airspace, every
encroachment of our national waters, and every
obstacle to marking the Blue Line. Time and again,
Israel has exploited allegations of arms smuggling to
systematically violate Lebanon’s sovereignty. Time and
again, we have called for evidence to be presented to
the Lebanese authorities and the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), through the
tripartite mechanism, for verification and immediate
action. Once again, the Secretary-General’s reiterates
in his most recent report on the implementation of
resolution 1701 (2006) the well-known fact that “[t]o
date, UNIFIL has neither been provided with, nor
found, evidence of the unauthorized transfer of arms
into its area of operations” (S/2011/406, para. 27).
Need I remind the Council of the disproportionate
use of force by the Israeli army against civilians in
southern Lebanon? Let me just refer to the
demonstrations that took place on 15 May. It is
indisputable that every single victim of Israeli bullets
was an unarmed civilian. These unarmed civilians
might have tossed stones across the Blue Line, yet they
were met with bullets, rendering the lethal Israeli
response grossly disproportionate. Some may well have
reached the technical fence, but it is unquestionable
that those unarmed civilians who were shot were all
shot on Lebanese territory, which makes the Israeli
response indefensible once again. Suffice it here to
quote yet again from the Secretary-General’s report:
“The firing of live ammunition by the Israel
Defense Forces across the Blue Line against the
demonstrators, which resulted in the loss of
civilian life and a significant number of
casualties, constituted a violation of resolution
1701 (2006) and was not commensurate with the
threat to Israeli soldiers.” (ibid., para. 9)
Let me also remind the Council that 10 months
ago Mr. Michael Williams informed us about the
decision of the Israeli Cabinet to, in principle,
withdraw from Al-Ghajar. We then said that seeing is
believing. Here we are again 10 months later, and all
we see is what the Secretary-General himself saw and
clearly states in his report, to the effect that Israel
“continued its occupation of the northern part of
Ghajar village and an adjacent area of land north of the
Blue Line, in violation of resolution 1701 (2006)”
(ibid., para. 12). Not only the chapter of Al-Ghajar, but
also the chapters of the Shab’a farms and the Kfar
Shuba Hills, should be closed once and for all. We
encourage the Secretary-General to intensify his
diplomatic efforts to ensure that Israel withdraws from
these areas.
Let me now touch on the delimitation of the
borders of Lebanon’s territorial waters and exclusive
economic zone, which are another source of tension. I
wish to stress here that my Government has dealt with
this sensitive matter with utmost responsibility and in
conformity with its rights and obligations under
international law.
As members of the Council are aware, more than
a year ago Lebanon delimited its southern and south-
western maritime borders in accordance with its
obligations under the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea, and deposited its charts and
coordinates with the Secretary-General, in full
compliance with international norms and procedures.
One year after Lebanon’s deposition, Israel, which is
not a party to the Convention, is claiming to assert its
alleged right over offshore areas that include a
significant portion of Lebanon’s exclusive economic
zone, thereby once again encroaching upon my
country’s sovereign rights.
Let me conclude by stressing that Lebanon, as a
host country, considers the safety and security of
UNIFIL and United Nations personnel to be a priority.
That is why the Lebanese authorities not only
condemned the attacks on UNIFIL of 27 May and
26 July, but also launched investigations to bring the
perpetrators to justice. In the same spirit, the Higher
Defence Council stressed, in its statement issued on
12 August, its coordination and cooperation with
UNIFIL and the protection of its movements in
Lebanon.
The President: There are no furthers speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 3.30 p.m.
