The meeting was called to order at 11.10 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Afghanistan
The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Afghanistan, in which he requests to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council’s
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the consideration of the
item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Tanin
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2008/376, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Afghanistan, Belgium,
Croatia, France, Italy, the Russian Federation, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America, Viet
Nam
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1817 (2008).
I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the Security Council’s unanimous adoption
of resolution 1817 (2008) on combating the trafficking
in chemical precursors of heroin in Afghanistan, which
is one part of the overall fight against drug production
and trafficking, on the eve of the international
conference in support of Afghanistan, which will be
held in Paris tomorrow, 12 June 2008. The conference
reflects France’s renewed commitment to Afghanistan,
as decided upon by the President of the French
Republic, Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy. Its primary aim is to
reaffirm the international community’s political and
financial support for reconstruction in Afghanistan. It
will also serve to review the objectives and approaches
of donors, in the context of its consideration of the
Afghanistan Compact adopted at the London
Conference in 2006.
The Paris conference will give the Afghan
Government an opportunity to present its national
development strategy to the international community.
France shares the hope expressed by the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for
Afghanistan, Mr. Kai Eide, that the conference will
make it possible to craft a new agreement between the
international community and Afghanistan. It is in that
spirit of enhanced partnership that the issue of
combating the drugs trade will be addressed at the
conference; clearly, this is a major cause of concern for
the international community. Drug trafficking in
Afghanistan undermines efforts to attain good
governance. It is a source of financing for terrorism
and fuels threats to the country’s stability and security.
Here, France fully supports Afghanistan’s
National Drug Control Strategy and international
efforts to combat the scourge of drugs. It is particularly
important to support regional initiatives. Indeed, the
entire international community should act to shoulder
this collective responsibility. We particularly commend
the efforts and sacrifices made by Afghanistan and its
neighbours to combat drug trafficking.
Combating drug trafficking requires an integrated
approach taking into account all dimensions of the
phenomenon. For that reason, the London Pact sets out
cross-cutting priorities involving security, governance
and economic and social development. In particular,
S/PV.5907
308-37563
developing alternative livelihoods is essential to
success, as stressed in the resolution we have just
adopted.
France has sought an emphasis by the Security
Council on a particular element of the problem of
narcotics trafficking: combating trafficking in the
chemical precursors that are essential for processing
opium into heroin. That is a weak link with respect to
which we can and should step up our endeavours. A
system already exists for monitoring the trade in
chemical precursors; here, it should be emphasized that
the vast majority of these materials are used for
perfectly legitimate purposes. That system, which
seeks to prevent the diversion of these precursors for
illicit purposes, is based on the 1988 Vienna
Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances. The Paris Pact initiative,
begun in 2004 by the United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime in the context of follow-up to the
Conference on Drug Routes from Central Asia to
Europe, includes specific section on the trafficking of
precursors. It is also a good framework for enhancing
cooperation in this field.
But increased efforts by all are needed to use
existing mechanisms more effectively. We hope that
the adoption of today’s resolution will provide fresh
political impetus that will mobilize the international
community, in support of Afghanistan and its
neighbours and in close partnership with the relevant
agencies, such as the United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime and the International Narcotics Control
Board, on the issue of combating the trafficking in
chemical precursors in Afghanistan.
The adoption of this resolution on the eve of the
Paris conference indicates the international
community’s determined and unanimous commitment
to combat drugs — of which Afghanistan itself is the
primary victim. I thank the Afghan authorities for their
unflagging support for our initiative. My thanks go also
to the other countries of the region for their
constructive partnership in discussing the text of the
resolution, as well as to all members of the Security
Council for their very constructive participation,
including those that, along with Afghanistan, agreed to
sponsor the draft resolution we have just adopted.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation welcomes the
Security Council’s adoption of resolution 1817 (2008)
on controlling the illicit trade in chemical precursors
used for drug production in Afghanistan. We consider
that this complements the Security Council’s
systematic efforts to stabilize the situation in
Afghanistan and to bolster international support for its
Government in the fight against the threat posed by
terrorism and drugs. The Council’s decision is
especially significant in the light of the international
conference in support of Afghanistan, to be held
tomorrow in Paris. We hope that the present resolution
will help give further impetus to enhanced international
action on a comprehensive solution to the Afghan drug
problem, including success in carrying out the tasks
agreed upon at the Ministerial Conference organized in
Moscow in 2006.
The expanded production of Afghan heroin,
which is gaining a monopoly on the world drug market,
is giving rise to growing demand for supplies of
chemical precursors. Without a smoothly functioning
international system for controlling the movement of
precursors, it will be impossible to halt the trend
towards growing drug production and the consequent
financing of terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
The Security Council has sent a clear signal in
support of smoother and more efficient international
efforts in this field. We believe it is fundamentally
important to pursue efforts to strengthen control of
transnational movements of funds derived from illicit
trafficking in drugs and precursors, as well as of
money laundering and other criminal activities. The
purpose is to break the technological and financial
links in the chain of the contemporary drugs industry in
Afghanistan and to create a single system comprising
anti-drugs and financial security belts. In that regard,
we support the appeal for comprehensive
implementation of resolution 1735 (2006), including
with respect to individuals who use resources derived
from the illicit trafficking of drugs and precursors to
support terrorist groups.
We also support the resolution’s important
provision related to enhancing the role of regional
organizations in international efforts to counter the
flow of Afghan narcotics and to control precursors.
Successful counter-narcotics operations undertaken
with the participation of the Collective Security Treaty
Organization, a wide array of its international partners
and the Afghan authorities show the importance of
tapping the potential of regional organizations. It is our
view that pooling the efforts of the Collective Security
S/PV.5907
08-375634
Treaty Organization and the NATO-led International
Security Assistance Force could have a significant
positive effect.
Mr. Mantovani (Italy): We welcome the adoption
by consensus of this important resolution on an issue of
the greatest concern, related to counter-narcotics in
Afghanistan, thanks to the initiative of the French
delegation. We are confident that this step will give
political impetus to the fight against the illicit
trafficking in precursors in Afghanistan, in particular
through stricter implementation of existing obligations
under the relevant United Nations conventions. We are
pleased with this further demonstration of the cohesion
of the Council in addressing the situation in
Afghanistan. That cohesion is based on common
strategic interests that go beyond the issue under
consideration today.
It is also important that Afghanistan and the other
countries of the region were extensively consulted in
the preparation of this resolution. Every relevant actor
should feel comfortable with the content of the
resolution. Furthermore, we welcome the strong link
established in the text between this initiative and the
crucial role played by existing bodies and agencies. I
refer in particular to the Commission on Narcotic
Drugs of the Economic and Social Council; to the 1988
Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and its treaty body,
the International Narcotics Control Board; to the Paris
Pact; and to the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime. To achieve success in this field we need an
integrated approach within the United Nations system.
Finally, we hope that the adoption of this
resolution will galvanize the discussions on this issue
at tomorrow’s Paris conference on Afghanistan.
Obviously, there will be many more crucial topics to be
discussed in Paris. We will soon propose for the
consideration of the Council further possible actions to
reflect and acknowledge the outcome of the
conference.
The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.25 a.m.
