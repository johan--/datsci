The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Chad, the Central African Republic
and the subregion
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of the Central African Republic and
Chad, in which they request to be invited to participate
in the consideration of the item on the Council’s
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite
those representatives to participate in the consideration
of the item without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Poukré-Kono
(Central African Republic) and Mr. Allam-mi
(Chad) took seats at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2010/115, which contains the text of a
letter dated 3 March 2010 addressed to the President of
the Security Council by the Permanent Representative
of Chad to the United Nations.
I also wish to draw the attention of Council
members to document S/2010/129, which contains a
letter dated 11 March 2010 from the Secretary-General
to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
