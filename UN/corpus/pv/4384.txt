The meeting was called to order at 11.10 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Security Council resolution 1054 (1996) of
26 April 1996
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Sudan, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Erwa
(Sudan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
the agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2001/916, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Bangladesh, Colombia,
Jamaica, Mali, Mauritius, Singapore, Tunisia and
Ukraine.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian delegation is satisfied with the
way in which the Government of the Republic of the
Sudan has met the demands of Security Council
resolutions 1054 (1996) and 1070 (1996). We also note
the official statements in support of the lifting of the
anti-Sudan sanctions on the part of the Organization of
African Unity, the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-
Aligned Movement and the Group of Arab States,
which all indicate that Sudan has fully met all of the
demands that were made on it.
It is important that the Council objectively assess
the specific steps taken by the Government of Sudan to
remove the grounds that had led to the introduction of
sanctions. The Russian Federation views positively the
fact that Egypt and Ethiopia, which had once insisted
on imposing sanctions against Sudan, have now
officially withdrawn their claims against it and, in
principle, support the request of its Government for
lifting the sanctions regime.
Pursuant to the demands of the Security Council,
Sudan has now completed its accession to all
international anti-terrorist conventions, including
relevant inter-Arab and inter-African agreements.
Sudan’s conduct in good faith on this matter has
created conditions for the gradual normalization of its
relations with neighbouring States and in the region as
a whole.
We believe that the specific steps taken by the
Government of the Republic of the Sudan to meet the
demands in resolutions 1054 (1996) and 1070 (1996),
and also the positive reaction to this by the
international community, are sufficient grounds for the
Council’s now taking a decision to lift sanctions
against the Republic of the Sudan.
The President (spoke in French): I shall put to
the vote the draft resolution contained in document
S/2001/916.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bangladesh, China, Colombia, France, Ireland,
Jamaica, Mali, Mauritius, Norway, Russian
Federation, Singapore, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Against:
None.
Abstaining:
United States of America.
The President (spoke in French): The result of
the voting is as follows: 14 votes in favour, none
against and 1 abstention. The draft resolution has been
adopted as resolution 1372 (2001).

S/PV.4384
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Cunningham (United States): The United
States Government believes that the Government of
Sudan has taken substantial steps to meet the specific
demands of Security Council resolution 1054 (1996).
We note with concern, however, that the suspects
wanted in connection with the 1995 assassination
attempt on President Mubarak in Addis Ababa were not
turned over to the appropriate authorities. This was not
satisfactory.
However, we believe, as do the Governments of
Egypt and Ethiopia, that they are no longer in Sudan.
In this regard, we take very seriously the letters sent to
the Council by the Governments of Egypt and
Ethiopia — the victims of the incident that led to the
Security Council actions on Sudan — calling for a
lifting of Council sanctions anyway. We strongly urge
the authorities of all States to continue the effort to
bring these suspects to justice.
Sudan has recently apprehended extremists within
that country whose activities may have contributed to
international terrorism. Sudan is also engaged in
serious discussions with my Government about ways to
combat terrorism. We welcome those steps and expect
this cooperation to continue. We expect the
Government of Sudan to demonstrate a full
commitment to the fight against international terrorism
by taking every step to expel terrorists and deny them
safe haven.
The United States also has continuing concerns
about the enormous suffering of the Sudanese people.
The civil war in the Sudan has lasted some 18 years
and has caused immense human misery. Two million
people have died; there have been massive
displacements of civilians; human rights continue to be
abused; and human beings there continue to be treated
as slaves.
My Government will continue to demand that the
Government of Sudan address these issues while we
work to build greater cooperation in the international
fight against terrorism. The President named a truly
distinguished American, Senator John Danforth, to
engage Sudan on these and other issues. In light of
these considerations, the United States has abstained on
this resolution.
Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom very much welcomes the fact that the
Government of Sudan has complied as far as
practicable with the conditions for lift in Security
Council resolution 1054 (1996). Today’s resolution
sends out a clear signal that the Council stands ready to
act once it has determined that a country has complied
with the demands set out in a resolution. Other States
that currently support terrorism should take note and be
led by the example which Sudan has set.
We particularly welcome Sudan’s recent
cooperation with the international community against
terrorism, even before the terrible events of 11
September. The fact that Sudan has ratified the relevant
conventions on terrorism is a clear signal of that
Government’s intent. The United Kingdom remains
actively interested in the pursuit of a just and lasting
peace agreement, which will benefit all the people of
Sudan. The lifting of these sanctions will allow the
intensification of diplomatic activity to this end. We
look forward to the day when the Security Council’s
discussions of Sudan can focus on international support
for such a peace settlement.
Mr. Ryan (Ireland): The Irish Government has
taken note of and welcomes the steps taken by the
Government of Sudan to comply with the provisions of
Security Council resolutions 1054 (1996) and 1070
(1996). As the requirements for lifting the sanctions
have now been met, my Government agrees with the
terms of the resolution before us.
While the Security Council is today
acknowledging that the very specific requirements for
the lifting of the sanctions have been met, and for that
reason the sanctions are being lifted, the Irish
Government remains deeply concerned at the wider
political, humanitarian and human rights situation in
the Sudan. We call on the Government of the Sudan to
cease immediately any targeting of the civilian
population and to allow the safe delivery of
humanitarian assistance to those in need. We urge the
Government of the Sudan to engage urgently in serious
negotiations, through the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development process, on a just and lasting political
settlement to the conflict in the Sudan and to negotiate
a comprehensive ceasefire.
The President (spoke in French): I call on the
Permanent Representative of the Sudan.

S/PV.4384
Mr. Erwa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is an
honour at the outset to warmly congratulate you,
Mr. President, on your impressive performance in
presiding over the deliberations of the Security Council
during the month of September. I also wish to
congratulate your predecessor, the Permanent
Representative of Colombia, on his excellent
stewardship of the Council during the past month.
I wish to welcome the Secretary-General. We are
very pleased at his presence at this important meeting,
at which an issue that affects my country is being
debated.
I address the Council following its adoption of
the resolution to lift sanctions against the Sudan. This
resolution has come as the fruit of enormous efforts
undertaken by the Sudan in order to cooperate with the
international community, as represented by the Security
Council, on the basis of the firm tenets of the Sudan’s
foreign policy, which is anchored in our commitment to
promote conditions of international peace and security,
the primary objective of this Council.
I wish to take this opportunity to thank all
members of the Security Council who have appreciated
my country’s seriousness and good faith in putting an
end to the factors that led to the imposition of sanctions
against my country in 1996. Special thanks go to the
Non-Aligned Movement caucus in the Council, which
sponsored this resolution on behalf of the larger
membership of the Non-Aligned Movement. I also
wish to thank the permanent members of the Council,
who have appreciated my country’s wisdom and
positive honouring of its commitment to comply with
the relevant Security Council resolutions.
More than one year has elapsed since the question
of lifting the sanctions against the Sudan was last
debated in the Security Council. In fact, that happened
during your previous presidency of the Council, Sir.
During this period many bilateral dialogues were
undertaken between the Sudan and some members of
the Security Council. Despite the fact that such
dialogues delayed the adoption of this resolution for
some time, we can safely say that they were
constructive and useful and were characterized by
constructive and professional diplomatic work. We
believe that this will lay a solid foundation for wider
areas of cooperation in the future.
In closing, I would like to take this historic
opportunity to assure the Council, on behalf of the
Government and the people of my country, that the
resolution just adopted represents a strong impetus for
my country to proceed forward and to cooperate in
efforts to eliminate terrorism, and to engage in the
mainstream work of the international community and
its organs, foremost of which is the Security Council,
in order to eliminate international terrorism in all its
forms and manifestations, with a view to creating a
world where justice, peace, security and stability reign
supreme.
The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.25 a.m.
