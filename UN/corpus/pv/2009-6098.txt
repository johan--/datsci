The meeting was called to order at 1.15 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Afghanistan
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation in Afghanistan and its implications for
international peace and security (S/2009/135)
The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Afghanistan, in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the consideration of the
item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the consideration of the item without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Tanin
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/152, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Japan.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2009/135, containing the report of the
Secretary-General on the situation in Afghanistan and
its implications for international peace and security.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1868 (2009).
Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation supports the extension of the mandate of the
United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and
voted in favour of the resolution. Nevertheless, we wish
to state our regret over the weakening of the language
through the failure in the operative part explicitly to
address our concern over the increase in civilian
casualties, as the Security Council has done in previous
resolutions. We know, of course, that insurgents are
primarily responsible for civilian casualties in
Afghanistan, but this Council has repeatedly called on
all parties to respect the provisions of international
humanitarian law and human rights, and to take every
possible precaution to ensure the protection of the
civilian population in that country. My delegation
understands that this concern is alluded to in paragraph
14 of resolution 1868 (2009), just adopted.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.
