08-361232
The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Greece,
Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, the Republic of
Korea, Somalia and Spain, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Duale
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table; the
representatives of the other aforementioned
countries took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council chamber.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/351, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, the Republic
of Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Having a long-standing
history of cooperation with the friendly country of
Somalia, Indonesia has always joined others in
assisting Somalia in meeting the major challenges that
have afflicted its stability and security for almost
17 years now. My delegation would therefore like to
reiterate that Indonesia fully supports the request of
Somalia ‚Äî as reflected in the letter of the Transitional
Federal Government to the President of the Council ‚Äî
for assistance from the international community in its
efforts to address acts of piracy and armed robbery
against ships off the coast of Somalia.
In attempting to formulate a positive response to
the Somali request in the form of the draft resolution
upon which the Council is about to take a decision,
Indonesia is guided by the proposition that any draft
should be formulated in consistency with two
fundamental principles.
First, the draft resolution shall be consistent with
international law, particularly the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 1982,
and shall not envisage any modification of the existing,
carefully balanced international law of the sea, which
is encapsulated in the constitution of the ocean, that is,
UNCLOS, which was brought into being after decades
of negotiation. It shall also not become a basis of
customary international law for the repression of piracy
and armed robbery at sea. Actions envisaged in the
draft resolution shall only apply to the territorial waters
of Somalia, based upon its prior consent.
Secondly, the draft resolution must address solely
the specific situation of piracy and armed robbery off
the coast of Somalia, as requested by the Somali
Government.
Like Somalia and most other Members of the
United Nations, Indonesia is a faithful party to
UNCLOS, of 1982. Consequently, we have legal
obligations to preserve the rights, obligations and
responsibilities of Member States derived from it, as
those were carefully negotiated in order to ensure, in a
balanced manner, the interest of coastal and user
States. A burden of responsibility rests upon us all to
maintain the Convention‚Äôs integrity and sanctity. Thus,
it is our duty to voice strong reservations if there are
actions envisaged by the Council or any other forum
that could lead to modifying, rewriting or redefining
UNCLOS, of 1982.
S/PV.5902
308-36123
Ample safeguards, therefore, need to be
imbedded, ensured and maintained. We are pleased in
this regard that that is reflected in the formulation of
paragraph 9 of the draft resolution (S/2008/351), which
states, inter alia,
‚ÄúThat the authorization provided in this
resolution ... shall not affect the rights or
obligations or responsibilities of Member States
under international law, including any rights or
obligations under the Convention, ... and ... it
shall not be considered as establishing customary
international law.‚Äù
The constitution of the ocean, which
provides guiding principles for all activities
pertaining to the use of the sea and ocean affairs,
including international cooperation for the
repression of piracy and armed robbery against
vessels, is thus not modified, rewritten or
redefined. It is in the interests of all that any
actions against illegal or criminal acts shall not
violate existing laws and norms.
We are mindful of the specific situation of
Somalia. The continued political instability that has
constantly faced that country has led to the inability of
its law enforcement to maintain stability and security.
That situation occurs not only on its mainland but also
extends to the waters off the coast of Somalia. Thus,
we understand that the unique situation of Somalia
requires an exceptional measure by the international
community to deal with the problem of piracy and
armed robbery against vessels. In that regard, the
request and consent of the Somali Government serves
as the legal basis for the Council to formulate
appropriate responses within the parameters of
international law, in particular UNCLOS, of 1982.
While we are mindful that piracy and armed
robbery at sea would affect the safety of international
navigation, we constantly are of the view that the
Council needs to exercise caution in trying to address
such acts in other parts of the globe. We are pleased in
this context that such caution is exercised in paragraph
14, which reads as follows:
‚ÄúRequests the Secretary-General of the IMO
to brief the Council on the basis of cases brought
to his attention by the agreement of all affected
coastal States and duly taking into account the
existing bilateral and regional cooperative
arrangements, on the situation with respect to
piracy and armed robbery‚Äù.
This caution, undoubtedly, once again reflects the
unwavering commitment of the Council to uphold
international law in spirit and in letter ‚Äî nothing more,
nothing less. Indonesia strongly believes that the
principle of respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity, as enshrined in the Charter, has to be
espoused by the Council at all times. We consider that
in exercising its mandate for the maintenance of
international peace and security, it is possible for the
Council to act without having to challenge the integrity
of international law; that can certainly be done. Those
two objectives are mutually reinforcing, not mutually
exclusive. The stability and predictability of the
international system that we all treasure are ensured as
long as those two objectives continue to serve us in
guiding our work. Today, the Council will shortly
confirm that that is the case.
As it stands, we view that the current text has
accommodated those two fundamental principles, as
my delegation stated earlier. Those are: consistency
with UNCLOS; and the specific situation of piracy and
armed robbery off the coast of Somalia. After all, the
text is first and foremost about Somalia. It is about
how the Council, together with the international
community, can assist Somalia to fight that crime. This
text will ensure that Somalia will be the beneficiary of
our common efforts.
Before concluding my remarks, I wish to express
my delegation‚Äôs gratitude for the understanding shown
by all members of the Council. The spirit of
cooperation and resourcefulness exercised by the
sponsors has led us to this consensus text that meets
the needs and legitimate interests of all members of the
Council. For those pertinent reasons, my delegation is
now ready to support it.
The President: I now put to the vote the draft
resolution contained in document S/2008/351.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America,
Viet Nam
S/PV.5902
08-361234
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1816 (2008).
I shall now call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements following the voting.
Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): First of all,
Sir, my delegation would like to congratulate you and
the United States of America on your assumption of the
presidency of the Council for this month. We are
convinced that under your stewardship the Council will
accomplish its duties in an efficient manner.
We wish also to express our deep appreciation to
the United Kingdom for its service to the Council last
month as it assumed the Council presidency.
Viet Nam shares the concern of the international
community over acts of piracy and armed robbery
against vessels in the waters off the coast of Somalia,
which pose a great threat to international navigation
and the delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia. My
country is fully committed to fighting against piracy at
sea and always supports international cooperation on
anti-piracy in conformity with the provisions of
international law and the 1982 United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The
resolution drawn up and adopted at the request of and
with the consent of the Transitional Federal
Government of Somalia provides for cooperative
activities to combat piracy and armed robbery in the
waters adjacent to Somalia under the conditions
sanctioned by UNCLOS.
For those reasons, Viet Nam voted in favour of
the resolution and wishes to reaffirm that the resolution
shall not be interpreted as allowing any action that is
contrary to international law, the Charter and the 1982
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to be
taken within the maritime areas under the jurisdiction
of a coastal State.
Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke
in Arabic): Allow me at the outset to congratulate you,
Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Council for this month; I wish you every success. I
would like to commend the delegation of the United
Kingdom for the excellent manner in which they
conducted the Council‚Äôs work last month.
I would like to place on record that my delegation
voted in favour of the resolution that we have just
adopted on the understanding that the resolution relates
to piracy in the waters under Somalia‚Äôs sovereignty and
is in response to a request by the Government of
Somalia. The resolution does not include any provision
that would touch on the sovereignty of other countries
or run counter to the principles of international law or
the law of the sea.
Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): We congratulate you,
Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Security
Council, and we also congratulate the delegation of the
United Kingdom on its excellent stewardship of the
Council during the month of May.
We welcome the adoption of resolution 1816
(2008) today. In negotiating and agreeing to the
resolution, we were guided by the fact that it limits
itself to the situation in Somalia. We should be clear
that it is the situation in Somalia, not piracy in and of
itself, that constitutes a threat to international peace
and security. Piracy is a symptom of the situation in
Somalia.
Furthermore, the resolutions of this Council must
respect the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea. The Convention remains the basis for
cooperation between States on the issue of piracy.
Most importantly, the Council should not lose
focus on the bigger issue in Somalia, specifically the
need to address the political, security and humanitarian
situation on the ground. In that regard, we welcomed
the adoption of resolution 1814 (2008) last month. That
resolution sent a signal to the people of Somalia that
the international community is serious about assisting
them in resolving their conflict.
We reiterate the Council‚Äôs willingness to consider
at the appropriate time a peacekeeping operation to
take over the African Union Mission in Somalia once
there is progress in the political process and
improvement in the security situation on the ground, as
provided for in resolution 1814 (2008).
We are pleased that the Security Council‚Äôs visit to
Africa has begun with a discussion on Somalia. We
hope that the visit will provide impetus to the ongoing
international efforts to resolve the conflict in Somalia.
Mr. La Yifan (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
wishes to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of
the presidency of the Security Council this month. We
wish to express our gratitude and appreciation to
Ambassador Sawers of the United Kingdom for his
S/PV.5902
508-36123
outstanding work during his presidency of the Council
last month.
China has always respected the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Somalia.
China supports the process of national reconciliation in
Somalia and appreciates the unremitting efforts of its
Government and people to achieve peace and stability.
After 17 years of civil war, the peace that the
people of Somalia have been anxiously awaiting
remains elusive. That calls for the international
community to focus its attention on Somalia as one of
the hot spot issues in Africa.
The question of Somalia has an important place
on the agenda of the Security Council. The Council‚Äôs
mission to Africa landed on African soil yesterday and
will soon be on its way to Djibouti to start addressing
the question of Somalia. That demonstrates fully the
importance that members of the Security Council
attach to the question of Somalia. The Security Council
should increase its attention to and input into the
question of Somalia.
The rise of piracy on the territorial waters of
Somalia in recent years constitutes a grave threat to the
political and peace processes of Somalia and the
international efforts for humanitarian relief. It
interferes with the safety and security of international
shipping. On many occasions, the Transitional Federal
Government of Somalia has sent letters to the Security
Council calling for the Council‚Äôs assistance in
combating piracy. The international community
broadly supports that reasonable request from Somalia
and is in favour of the Security Council adopting a
resolution to authorize Member States to assist in
combating piracy. China endorses that position and
supports the prompt adoption of a relevant resolution
in the Security Council.
Meanwhile, as the question of piracy touches
upon sensitive issues of international law and touches
closely upon the rights and interests of States Members
of the United Nations in the oceans, the Security
Council must therefore act with great prudence. Its
actions should facilitate the international community‚Äôs
assistance to Somalia in combating piracy, on the one
hand, and avoid negative consequences on the other.
Therefore, we maintain that the relevant
resolution must be based on the consent of the
countries concerned and in line with the wishes of the
Government and the people of Somalia. It should apply
only to the territorial waters of Somalia and not be
expanded to cover other regions. It must comply with
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
and should not conflict with existing international law.
Based on the positions I have just mentioned, the
Chinese delegation took an active part in the relevant
informal consultations. Resolution 1816 (2008),
adopted today, encapsulates to the greatest extent
possible the common understanding that the Security
Council has been able to achieve at present on the
question of piracy in Somalia. It is a positive and
prudent resolution; accordingly, China voted in favour
of it.
In the course of its implementation, various
problems may arise that will require the continued
cooperation of the international community. China
believes that the question of piracy in Somalia should
not be seen as a stand-alone issue because it is merely
an expression of the political contradictions in
Somalia. The international community, while helping
Somalia to combat piracy, should focus its attention on
removing the root causes of the current situation in
Somalia. China is ready to join the rest of the
international community in its ongoing effort to
promote a timely solution to the question of Somalia
and the achievement of peace and stability in the Horn
of Africa.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain
seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 3.40 p.m.
