The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.
Expression of farewell to Mr. Marcello Spatafora,
Permanent Representative of Italy to the
United Nations
The President: As this is the last time that
Ambassador Marcello Spatafora will participate in a
Council meeting in his capacity as Permanent
Representative of Italy, I wish to take this opportunity
to express to him, on behalf of the members of the
Council, our appreciation of him, both as a colleague
and as a friend. Ambassador Spatafora’s diplomatic
skill, affable manner and sense of collegiality have
made him a highly effective representative of his
country. His distinguished career has been
characterized by many challenging postings, where he
has always endeavoured to build bridges and achieve
better understanding.
Ambassador Spatafora will be remembered as a
fervent advocate of the work of the Council who
always strived to work in cooperation and harmony
with other Council members. His remarkable
contributions to the work of the Council and the
passion he has put into his work by speaking straight
from his heart will always be remembered by his
colleagues with gratitude.
In bidding Ambassador Spatafora a fond farewell,
the other members of the Council and I wish him every
success in his new undertakings.
Mr. Spatafora (Italy): I thank you very much,
Mr. President, for your words. To you and to all my
colleagues and friends around this table go my most
sincere thanks for the friendship and the cooperation
that have been offered me. Thanks to all the members
of the Council, my experience in the Security Council
has been very rewarding.
There have been a lot of challenges and
achievements. There has also been, unfortunately, a lot
of frustration when we have not succeeded in
delivering what the outside world, especially those
who are the most vulnerable and those who suffer on
the ground, was expecting from us and from the United
Nations.
There is indeed an ever-increasing demand by the
people of the world for a more effective Security
Council action and presence. Expectations to that end
are very high and important challenges are ahead of
this Council. I believe that the best way for the Council
to be successful in addressing the issues before it,
however difficult and sensitive they may be, is first of
all to strengthen its listening culture. That listening
culture should be more open and receptive to the
feelings and values prevailing among the members in
general and among interested parties in particular. We
sit here around this table on behalf of all United
Nations Member States, and if we do not nurture
within the membership at large a perception of
ownership of the Security Council’s proceedings, then
it will be difficult at the end of the day to
have implementation and compliance, because
implementation and compliance will be there only if
ownership is preserved at the same time.
There should be no surprise that Article 25 of the
Charter concerning the binding nature of the decisions
of the Council, is fading from our radar screen. The
listening culture that I was referring to implies that we
have to make every possible effort to understand each
other. To do so is a sign of strength, not of weakness. If
we listen and understand, it will be easier to work
together with equal dignity and mutual respect, which
are building blocks towards effectiveness and results-
oriented action.
We must never lose sight of the fact that what
matters most at the end of the day is to be able to
deliver and have an impact on the ground, so that the
Security Council will make a difference and be
perceived as doing so. What is at stake is our
credibility and our relevance, and I am grateful to all
my colleagues here for how we have managed to make
some progress along the path before us in preventing
the progressive irrelevance and marginalization of this
Council, a situation in which all of us in the
international community at large would be losers.
For me, these 19 months in the Security Council
have been months in which I have learned a lot. I have
been indeed fortunate to work together with the entire
Council on so many challenging and sensitive issues
along a common path towards our common and shared
objectives. I will take with me a lot of memories and, I
suppose, a lot of nostalgia too.
Allow me to conclude by quoting from a farewell
letter that my wife and I received from the United
Nations African Mothers Association, an important
association that is very close to our hearts. The letter,
signed by the President of the Association,
S/PV.5946
308-44376
Mrs. Kumalo, the wife of the Permanent
Representative of South Africa, recalls that “in Africa
we say mountains never meet, but people who have
ever crossed each others’ path are likely to meet
again”. With those words, I say farewell to all of my
friends here, and I urge them to take care of themselves
and of their loved ones. I will not forget them.
The President: I thank Ambassador Spatafora for
his statement. Once again, I wish him all the best.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation between Eritrea and Ethiopia
Special report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea (S/2008/226)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/491, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium. Members also
have before them document S/2008/226, containing the
special report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, and document
S/2008/496, containing a letter dated 28 July 2008
from the Secretary-General addressed to the President
of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America,
Viet Nam
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1827 (2008).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Grauls (Belgium) (spoke in French): The
end of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea (UNMEE), eight years after its creation and
eight years after the end of the war between the two
countries, is an important decision for the Security
Council.
The border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea
remains unresolved, and the United Nations is
withdrawing without having been able to help the two
countries find common ground, but not without having
tried everything possible to achieve that. Neither the
good offices of the Secretary-General nor the
constructive proposals presented to the parties by the
Council were able to attain their objective.
Unfortunately, the work of UNMEE is coming to
an end not because its mandate has been accomplished,
but because that mandate has become impossible to
carry out. As a peacekeeping mission, UNMEE was
increasingly restricted in its freedom of movement by
Eritrea, to the point that it was compelled to leave the
buffer zone that it was initially supposed to monitor. As
an administrative and logistical support mission for
border demarcation, UNMEE was also hindered in
fulfilling that area of its mandate by Ethiopia’s refusal
to implement the decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia
Boundary Commission.
The responsibility for the current impasse rests
with the parties and with them alone. Only they can
decide to emerge from the vicious circle by ending the
fruitless game of mutual accusations and by choosing
the path of dialogue, in the primary interest of their
populations and in the interest of peace in the Horn of
Africa. The international community remains ready to
assist them in doing so.
Despite the substantive impasse, Belgium, like
the vast majority of other Council members, would
have preferred to maintain a United Nations presence
on the ground as a tangible signal of the availability of
the United Nations to work for a balanced and lasting
solution. In fact, the two countries reject such a
presence.
S/PV.5946

Belgium hopes that, once the tension created by
the turmoil surrounding UNMEE and its future has
abated, an atmosphere more conducive to dialogue will
emerge. The resolution that we have just adopted calls
on the Secretary-General to continue his efforts and to
keep the Council regularly informed.
The Algiers Agreements and the decisions of the
Boundary Commission remain the legal basis upon
which dialogue will have to be built. The Council calls
firmly on Ethiopia and Eritrea to cooperate in the
process of terminating UNMEE and to scrupulously
avoid any hindrance to the smooth functioning of that
process.
As the Mission closes, Belgium gratefully thanks
the troop-contributing countries and all the military
and civilian personnel involved in its work.
The President: Before adjourning this meeting, I
should like, on behalf of the Council, to express
sincere thanks to all the men and women who have
served the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea over the past seven years for their dedication
and professionalism in carrying out the mandate
entrusted to them by the Security Council.
There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.35 a.m.
