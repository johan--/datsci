The President (interpretation from French): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Croatia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Drobnjak
(Croatia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (interpretation from French): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members have before them the report of the Secretary-
General pursuant to Security Council resolution
1043 (1996), documents S/1996/472 and Addendum 1.
Members of the Council also have before them document
S/1996/601, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council’s consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/1996/601) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
