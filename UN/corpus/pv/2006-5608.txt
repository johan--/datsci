The meeting was called to order at 10.45 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Sierra Leone
Third report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra
Leone (S/2006/922)
The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of the Netherlands and Sierra Leone, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Pemagbi
(Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Majoor (Netherlands) took the seat reserved
for him at the side of the Council Chamber.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
third report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone, contained in
document S/2006/922.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/1012, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1734 (2006).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom welcomes the adoption by unanimity
of resolution 1734 (2006). It widely recognizes the
huge steps that Sierra Leone has taken over the past
few years, and in particular over the past 12 months
since the last United Nations peacekeeper left and the
United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone
(UNIOSIL) was established under resolution 1620
(2005).
Only a few years ago, Sierra Leone was the site
of Africa‚Äôs most gruesome civil war. Over the past 12
months, in comparison, Sierra Leone has continued to
move forward. A strategy for reforming the civil
service has been finalized; judicial and security sector
reform continue; the armed forces and police have
increased their capacity and professionalism; refugees
have returned home; and steps to improve human rights
have been taken, notably through the establishment of
the National Human Rights Commission.
Crucial to reconciliation and the establishment of
the rule of law has been the work of the Special Court
for Sierra Leone, and in particular the detention and
forthcoming trial in The Hague of former Liberian
President Charles Taylor. That sends a clear message
that there is no impunity. It also underlines the
importance of a regional approach.
Over the next 12 months, the efforts of the
Government of Sierra Leone, with our support, must be
consolidated and continued. There is still a mountain to
climb. Adult literacy stands at just 35 per cent. The
probability of living until the age of 40 is only 47 per
cent. There are three physicians per 100,000 people,
and 50 per cent of the population suffer from
undernourishment and live on less than $1 a day.

So, in the next year we see three priority areas:
first, the fight against corruption; secondly, civil
service reform; and thirdly, the development of clear
policies and strategies, in particular to tackle youth
unemployment, to tackle poverty and to generate
economic development.
The year 2007 will be a milestone year for Sierra
Leone. July‚Äôs presidential and parliamentary elections
will be crucial towards building a successful,
sustainable democracy. All parties in Sierra Leone must
demonstrate their full and unconditional commitment
to a full democratic process. International support will
be vital. To that end, the resolution temporarily
increases the number of military and police advisers, to
enable the Office to support the election process
without having to cut back on its work elsewhere. It
also calls on the Secretary-General to conduct an
assessment of UNIOSIL‚Äôs role closer to that election
date, so that, as Sierra Leone makes a transition
towards sustainable and peaceful economic
development, that can be properly handled.
That process will be reinforced by the longer-
term international attention and support to be provided
by the inclusion of Sierra Leone, at its request, on the
agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission. The Security
Council should work closely with the Commission to
benefit from its advice as we move forward. So, the
participation today of the representative of the
Netherlands is very welcome, and we congratulate him
on his appointment as Chair of the meetings of the
Peacebuilding Commission on Sierra Leone.
I should like to highlight the particular need for
further work within Sierra Leone on implementing
resolution 1325 (2000). Gender inequality remains a
serious problem, yet women‚Äôs empowerment is central
to peace consolidation and good governance. There is a
particular need to ensure that women are able to
participate fully in the 2007 election, both as electors
and as candidates, as called for in today‚Äôs resolution. A
gender perspective should be taken fully into account
in implementing the mandate we have agreed upon
today. I look forward to the next Secretary-General
reporting to the Council on an action plan agreed upon
with the Government of Sierra Leone in order to
implement resolution 1325 (2000).
Sierra Leone is a country close to the heart of the
Secretary-General, as well as to his home in Ghana.
So, it is particularly appropriate that this should be one
of the last resolutions adopted by the Council during
Kofi Annan‚Äôs tenure as Secretary-General. From Sierra
Leone to the Sudan to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, the Secretary-General has demonstrated a
tireless commitment over the past 10 years ‚Äî indeed,
over his professional lifetime ‚Äî to building peace and
prosperity in Africa and to calling upon nations to
protect those whose national Governments cannot do
so. Africa and Sierra Leone are better places thanks to
his efforts, and so is the United Nations.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the
floor to the representative of the Netherlands, who will
address the Council in his capacity as Chair of the
meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission on Sierra
Leone.
Mr. Majoor (Netherlands): Upon requests by the
Government of Sierra Leone and the Security Council,
the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding
Commission last June selected Sierra Leone to be one
of the first countries to be considered by the
Peacebuilding Commission. I very much welcome this
opportunity to inform the Council about the
discussions undertaken in the two country-specific
meetings on Sierra Leone which took place in the
framework of the Peacebuilding Commission on
12 October and 13 December 2006. The Chair of the
Peacebuilding Commission‚Äôs Organizational
Committee, Ambassador Gaspar Martins of the
Republic of Angola, who chaired the first country-
specific meeting, has shared with the Council the
Chairman‚Äôs summary of the most recent meeting.
Allow me to highlight some key outcomes of our
discussions both last week and during the first country-
specific meeting on Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone,
important achievements have been made to date in
restoring peace and stability and promoting post-
conflict recovery. This was highlighted during both
country-specific meetings. The Commission welcomed
the efforts of the international community in
supporting the Government in developing and
implementing the various strategies: the poverty
reduction strategy, the medium-term expenditure
framework and the peace consolidation strategy.
Members stressed that all peacebuilding efforts should
be linked to the existing strategies under the leadership
and ownership of the Government of Sierra Leone.
Members and the Government of Sierra Leone agreed
that specific challenges under four critical areas need
to be addressed: social and youth empowerment and

employment; consolidating democracy and good
governance; justice and security-sector reform; and
capacity-building.
Sierra Leone was declared eligible to benefit
from the Peacebuilding Fund. It is expected that a
country envelope of approximately $25 million can be
made available as an initial contribution. Members
urged the international community to ensure an
adequate level of external assistance and to lend
support to the Government of Sierra Leone to broaden
its donor base and secure assistance, including further
debt relief. Members called on the international
community to provide adequate resources and support
for the upcoming presidential and parliamentary
elections, including capacity-building to ensure the
equal participation of women in the electoral process.
In order to bring the discussions and the activities
within the country-specific meetings on Siena Leone
forward in months to come, the following was decided.
First, the Peacebuilding Support Office is to present a
calendar of ongoing and planned peacebuilding-related
activities in Sierra Leone.
Secondly, the Chair of the country-specific
meeting for Sierra Leone is to develop, in consultation
with members, a work plan with a clear timeline and
division of responsibilities for actions to be undertaken
by the Government, the United Nations system and
other stakeholders in preparation for the next country-
specific meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission.
Thirdly, a follow-up meeting of the Commission
on Siena Leone will be held in March 2007. It will
review actions and progress in the realization of
peacebuilding goals and priorities, the effectiveness of
international assistance and ways to enhance that
assistance.
Finally, upon the invitation of the Government of
Siena Leone, members will consider the possibility of a
visit to that country before the review.
In conclusion, I wish to underline three points.
First, the discussions within the framework of the
country-specific meetings on Sierra Leone have clearly
demonstrated members‚Äô intention to use the
Peacebuilding Commission to the benefit of the
countries under consideration, in this case Sierra
Leone.
Secondly, our most recent meeting built on the
first country-specific meeting in narrowing our focus
on the areas that require additional investment ‚Äî
financial and otherwise ‚Äî to allow Sierra Leone to
build a sustainable peace that can prevent it from
relapsing into conflict. In this process, the Government
of Sierra Leone has made a commendable effort to
highlight the gaps that need to be addressed.
Thirdly, in spite of the Peacebuilding
Commission and its country-specific formats being a
novelty without thoroughly tested working methods
and procedures, it has become clear that all members,
and the Government of Sierra Leone itself, engage
actively in its discussions. There is an acute awareness
of the potential of the Peacebuilding Commission for
the countries under its consideration and of our
responsibility to exploit it to the fullest. In that context,
I wish to thank the members of the Security Council
for their continued support for the work of the
Peacebuilding Commission, including through the
resolution the Council has just adopted.
It is my conviction that with the fruitful meetings
that have taken place, we have laid the foundation for a
comprehensive approach to post-conflict reconstruction
and development in Sierra Leone. We have also laid the
basis for a strong partnership between the Government
of Sierra Leone and the international community. It is
the deepening of that partnership in a spirit of
transparency and dialogue that will help to define the
Peacebuilding Commission as a useful body that can
make a difference to the process of consolidating peace
and development in Sierra Leone.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11 a.m.
