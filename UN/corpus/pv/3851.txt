The President (interpretation from French): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Georgia and Germany in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the discussion
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Chkheidze

of the Council Chamber.

accordance with the understanding reached in its prior

resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s prior

the Council to document S/1998/25, which contains the
text of a letter dated 12 January 1998 from the Permanent
Representative of Georgia to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General, transmitting the text
of a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of Georgia.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
