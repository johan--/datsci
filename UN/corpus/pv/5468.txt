The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Liberia in which she requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Osode
(Liberia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: Before turning to the item on the
agenda, let me take this opportunity to remind all
delegations that today is World Refugee Day.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/413, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
