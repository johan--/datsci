The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Nepal, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Acharya

its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them

Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2010/214, containing the report of the

dated 5 May 2010 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
