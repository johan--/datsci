The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia
The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Somalia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Duale
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/113, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America, Viet
Nam
The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1801 (2008).
I now open the floor to members of the Council
that would like to make statements after the vote.
Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): We voted in favour of
this draft resolution even though we would have
preferred that the Council defer taking a decision on this
matter until we have received the Secretary-General’s
report, as requested in resolution 1772 (2007) and once
again in a presidential statement later that same year,
adopted on 19 December 2007. Instead, we have
accepted a compromise through which this Council
commits itself to consider the Secretary-General’s report
as soon as it becomes available in early March 2008. It
will be important for the Council to do so, because we
have to demonstrate that the Security Council’s mandate
for maintaining international peace and security applies
to Somalia as well.
We expect that the Secretary-General’s report in
March will provide us with alternative approaches to
addressing the situation in Somalia, including the best
way to proceed, with the eventual deployment of a
United Nations mission in that country. Meanwhile, we
all know that the African Union Mission in Somalia
(AMISOM) has been doing a great job in maintaining
peace in Somalia despite its capacity challenges. The
problem for AMISOM is not just lack of resources, but
also that it was deployed as a stopgap measure until the
United Nations takes over.
The African Union Peace and Security Council, in
its communiqué of 18 January 2008, has, among other
things, stressed the urgent need for the deployment of a
United Nations peacekeeping operation and reiterated
that the United Nations also must provide support to
AMISOM. That call was endorsed by the African Union
summit, and the Group of African States reiterated the
request in a letter dated 12 February 2008 addressed to
the president of the Security Council.
The same urgency of the situation in Somalia was
also conveyed by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General in December 2007, when he appealed
to this Council to assume its responsibility towards
Somalia if the country is not to further deteriorate,
causing it to become an even greater threat to
international peace and security.
Somalia is in need not only of a peacekeeping
presence, but the international community also has an
obligation to support the political process that can bring
about lasting peace to this country. My delegation
remains committed to do whatever we can to make sure
S/PV.5842
308-24515
that the people of Somalia are not allowed to suffer any
more than they have.
The President (spoke in Spanish): I see no further
requests for the floor. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council will remain seized of
the matter.
The meeting rose at 3.30 p.m.
