The situation in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire
Twenty-third progress report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Operation in
C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire (S/2010/15)
The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate
in the consideration of the item without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Bailly (C√¥te
d‚ÄôIvoire) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/41, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by France.
I wish to draw the attention of members of the
Council to document S/2010/15, which contains the
twenty-third progress report of the Secretary-General
on the United Nations Operation in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. I
also wish to draw the attention of Council members to
documents S/2009/694, which contains a letter dated
29 December 2009 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council, and
S/2010/42, which contains a letter dated 15 January
2010 from the Secretary-General addressed to the
President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
