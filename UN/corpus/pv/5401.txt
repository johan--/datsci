The meeting was called to order at 12.50 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to
paragraph 6 of resolution 1644 (2005)
(S/2006/176)
The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Lebanon in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Assaker
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/176, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 6 of
resolution 1644 (2005).
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/186, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, the United
Kingdom and the United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1664 (2006).
I give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Boutros
Assaker, Acting Secretary-General of the Lebanese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants, who wishes
to make a statement.
Mr. Assaker (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): The
Lebanese Government welcomes the resolution
adopted by the Security Council, which mandates the
Secretary-General to begin negotiations with Lebanon
regarding the establishment of a tribunal of an
international character. The tribunal will follow up on
the findings of the investigation concerning the
assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and his
companions. My Government considers the unanimous
vote on the resolution, coupled with the Lebanese
consensus on the subject, to be a clear indication of the
international community’s strong commitment and
determination to punish ail those involved in that
terrorist crime. That, in turn, will deter criminals and
promote security and stability in Lebanon and
throughout the region.
The Lebanese Government will spare no effort to
conclude negotiations with the Secretary-General as
quickly as possible. My Government also expresses its
readiness to use all available means to arrive at a clear
and solid text for the agreement defining the form and
working methods of the tribunal — a text that would
earn the approval and support of the Council.
The values of truth, freedom and sovereignty are
complementary, and requisites for every democratic
regime. Uncovering the truth and trying those involved
will contribute significantly to the consolidation of
democracy in Lebanon. It will further reinforce
Lebanon’s sovereignty and preserve the freedom of its
people. We recognize the role played by you, Mr.
President, by the members of the Security Council and
by the Secretary-General in the realization of those
objectives.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 1 p.m.
