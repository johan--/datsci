inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the

the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
