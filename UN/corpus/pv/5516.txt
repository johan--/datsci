The situation in Timor-Leste

The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Timor-Leste, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
On behalf of the Security Council, I extend a
warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. José Luis
Guterres, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation
of Timor-Leste.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Guterres
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
documents S/2006/628 and S/2006/580, which contain
the reports of the Secretary-General on Timor-Leste
pursuant to Security Council resolution 1690 (2006)
and on justice and reconciliation for Timor-Leste,
respectively.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/686, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Japan.
I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2006/620, containing a letter
dated 4 August from the Chargé d’affaires ad interim of
the Permanent Mission of Timor-Leste to the President of
the Security Council, and documents S/2006/651 and
S/2006/668, containing letters dated 14 and 16 August,
respectively, from the Chargé d’affaires ad interim of
the Permanent Mission of Timor-Leste to the
Secretary-General.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2006/686) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.

agenda.
