Security Council 4026th meeting
Fifty-fourth year 28 July 1999
The meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Admission of new Members
Report of the Committee on the Admission of New
Members concerning the application of the
Kingdom of Tonga for admission to membership in
the United Nations (S/1999/823)
The President: Under the item on its agenda, the
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
report of the Committee on the Admission of New
Members concerning the application of the Kingdom of
Tonga for admission to membership in the United Nations,
which appears in document S/1999/823.
In paragraph 3 of the report, the Committee
recommends to the Council that it should have recourse to
the provision of the last paragraph of rule 60 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure in order to present
its recommendation to the fifty-third session of the General
Assembly. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the
Council wishes to waive the time limits set forth in the
penultimate paragraph of rule 60.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
In paragraph 4 of the report, the Committee
recommends to the Security Council the adoption of a draft
resolution on the application of the Kingdom of Tonga for
admission to membership in the United Nations. I should
like to congratulate the Committee on its unanimous
decision to recommend that the Kingdom of Tonga be
admitted to membership in the United Nations.
In accordance with the understanding reached in prior
consultations among members of the Council, I propose that
the Council adopt the draft resolution contained in
paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee on the
Admission of New Members without a vote.
As I see no objection, it is so decided.
I therefore declare that the draft resolution contained
in paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee on the
Admission of New Members, document S/1999/823, has
been adopted without a vote as resolution 1253 (1999).
I shall immediately convey the decision of the
Security Council recommending the admission of the
Kingdom of Tonga to membership in the United Nations
to the Secretary-General for transmittal to the General
Assembly in accordance with rule 60 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure.
I shall now make a statement, in my capacity as
President of the Security Council, on behalf of the
members of the Council.
“The Security Council has decided to
recommend to the General Assembly that the
Kingdom of Tonga be admitted as a Member of the
United Nations. On behalf of the members of the
Security Council, I wish to extend my
congratulations to the Kingdom of Tonga on this
historic occasion.
“The Council notes with great satisfaction the
Kingdom of Tonga’s solemn commitment to uphold
the purposes and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations and to fulfil all the obligations
contained therein. We look forward to the day in the
near future when the Kingdom of Tonga will join us
as a Member of the United Nations and to working
closely with its representatives.”
This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1999/23.
The Council has thus concluded its consideration of
the matter before it.
The meeting rose at 10.35 a.m.
