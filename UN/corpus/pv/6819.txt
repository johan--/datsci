Darfur (UNAMID) and recognizes its contribution to the
protection of civilians, the improvement of the security
situation and the promotion of peace and the political
process in Darfur. We note that some conclusions
drawn in resolution 2063 (2012) do not coincide with
our assessment of the current situation on the ground
and are not fully reflective of the Secretary-General’s
views contained in his recent reports on UNAMID. We
believe that some additional important elements could
have been included in the resolution. We also regret that
discussions on the draft resolution were not sufficiently
open, inclusive and transparent.
For these reasons, Azerbaijan decided to abstain in
the voting on the resolution just adopted.
Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):
Guatemala joined the consensus and voted in favour of
resolution 2063 (2012), which extends the mandate of
the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation
in Darfur (UNAMID) until 31 July 2013. We hope that
the adoption of the resolution will allow UNAMID
to continue to exercise the mandate granted by the
Council, particularly in protecting civilians and
assisting the efforts to arrive at a prompt peace and
stability in the region, based on the implementation of
the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur.
However, we note in our national capacity that,
while having voted in favour of the resolution, we have
serious reservations regarding paragraph 17, which
refers to the Lord’s Resistance Army. Although we
recognize that there may be indications of attacks by
guerilla or armed groups in the Sudan, the decisions of
the Council should be taken on the basis of evidence,
facts or concrete information of the events on the
ground. In the current case, the objective information
from the Secretariat does not provide a basis for
believing that there is any involvement of the Lord’s
Resistance Army in the zone covered by UNAMID.
Mr. Tarar (Pakistan): Pakistan supports a durable
and peaceful resolution of the Darfur issue through an
inclusive political process and in full respect for the
unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Sudan.
The African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) continues to play an
important role towards the realization of those goals,
as well as in the maintenance of peace and security
in Darfur. Pakistan has been closely associated with
the Mission. Our troops and police units have made
valuable contributions to its operations over the years,
The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
Report of the Secretary-General on the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur (S/2012/548)
The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representative of the Sudan to
participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2012/582, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by France, Germany, the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United
States of America.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2012/548, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
China, Colombia, France, Germany, Guatemala,
India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal, Russian
Federation, South Africa, Togo, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United
States of America
Abstentions:
Azerbaijan
The President: There were 14 votes in favour, none
against and one abstention. The draft resolution has
been adopted as resolution 2063 (2012).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): Azerbaijan supports

S/PV.6819
Mr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Hearing
the views of our colleagues can only help us to gain
a better understanding of any subject, but refusing to
listen to the ideas of others does not help in a practical
or constructive way to promote peace and security. We
represent States that enjoy full sovereignty, and while
we may fail to listen to others the relevant diplomatic
norms are clear.
(spoke in English)
We have a strong sense of dignity. We may ignore
others if we want to do so, but diplomatic norms will
not allow us to.
(spoke in Arabic)
Thus, with respect to the issue under consideration
and in accordance with those diplomatic norms, every
delegation must listen very patiently to the others and
respond logically on the basis of clear and precise
arguments.
The Sudan has consistently cooperated with the
African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur (UNAMID) since its establishment. The peace
process in Darfur has enjoyed achievements that hold
great promise for the future. We hope that it will achieve
its aim of allowing Darfur to enjoy lasting peace in
the near future, if God so wishes. We will pursue our
cooperation with UNAMID in the future until peace is
attained.
That will not prevent us, however, from raising
serious reservations with respect to paragraph 17
of resolution 2063 (2012), extending the mandate of
UNAMID, in which reference is made to the Lord’s
Resistance Army (LRA). These reservations arise
from the fact that no evidence is presented in any
report of the Secretary-General that the LRA is present
in Darfur. Even his most recent report (S/2012/548)
contains no indication of an LRA presence in the
province. Moreover, when Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, Joint
African Union-United Nations Special Representative
for Darfur, addressed the Council on 24 July (see
S/PV.6813), he made no reference whatsoever to an
LRA presence in Darfur.
Therefore, and on the basis of the logical argument
that I am making with respect to the LRA, we believe
that the resolution adopted today unfortunately does
not address certain important and substantive issues
relating to Darfur, which is at the heart of the Mission’s
and we will continue to support the important work
being undertaken by UNAMID in line with its mandate.
Pakistan believes that the effective implementation
of the UNAMID mandate and the objective of
establishing durable peace and security in Darfur can
best be achieved through cooperative and constructive
engagement with the Government of the Sudan.
Any actions or decisions to the contrary only risk
undermining the objective of peace and security in
Darfur.
Eight years after the Council took up the Darfur
issue, it is high time that we realize this imperative,
which is crucial to success in Darfur. We find it very
unhelpful that the text makes at best only a half-hearted
attempt at acknowledging the achievements of the
Government of Sudan and UNAMID. It also downplays
and trivializes the challenge posed by the ever-widening
network of alliances between Darfur-based rebel
movements and those outside Darfur with the declared
purpose of overthrowing the Government.
The refusal to mention the Sudan Revolutionary
Front in the Council’s decisions is not understandable.
While some of these important issues have been
ignored in the resolution, several others have been
included on which several members have reservations
and which have not even found mention in the reports
of the Secretary-General. This is certainly not a helpful
approach to advancing the goals of peace and stability
in the region. The final text of the resolution could have
been improved by including a more objective reflection
of the issues. The Pakistan delegation made several
proposals to that end; we are disappointed that they were
not accommodated. A long-standing and complicated
issue like that of Darfur requires the Council to send a
united and consensual message based on a transparent
and inclusive approach involving all Council members.
Transparency and inclusiveness in the negotiations
would have stood us in good stead.
Despite Pakistan’s several reservations on the
procedural and substantive aspects of the resolution,
Pakistan decided to vote in favour of the text in
order to support the efforts of the men and women of
UNAMID who are working for the establishment of
peace in the region. We will continue to play our role
in the establishment of durable peace in Darfur and the
broader region.
The President (spoke in Spanish): I give the floor to
the representative of the Sudan.

S/PV.6819
(spoke in English)
Although the Council is calling for an exchange of
information and cooperation between the peacekeeping
missions in the region, it does not do so where the
resolution concerns UNMISS in the south. We
would have expected it to include a call on UNMISS
to cooperate and exchange views and information
regarding all the Darfuri rebel groups being harboured
by the Government of South Sudan. This is strange.
(spoke in Arabic)
Lastly, we will cooperate with UNAMID, but we
have major reservations concerning paragraph 17, and
hope that the Council will reconsider its position in the
future.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Since today is 31 July and this is the last meeting
of the Council that I will preside over on behalf of
Colombia, I would like to warmly thank the members
of the Council for their support and cooperation this
month. It has been a particularly busy month for the
Security Council, with some 38 formal and informal
meetings held on very important subjects. I would also
like to thank the Secretariat for its service and support,
as well as our interpreters and Verbatim Reporters.
The meeting rose at 10.35 a.m.
mandate, yet raises an issue that has no connection with
the province.
The resolution contains no clear, strong and direct
condemnation of the Sudan Revolutionary Front, which
is the primary cause of the instability, lack of peace and
injustice in Darfur today. How can that be justified? I
appeal to the conscience of Council members. How can
the Council fail to seriously condemn rebel movements
that promote instability and undermine peace? Why
does the Council address issues that have no evidentiary
or logical basis? Is that fair?
(spoke in English)
Where is the clear and explicit condemnation of the
so-called Sudan Revolutionary Front? There is a total
absence of a clear, explicit reference to the Front; there
is only a very oblique, between-the-lines allusion to it.
(spoke in Arabic)
The Front has clearly affirmed its readiness to
violently overthrow the Government of the Sudan.
Finally, in order to ensure that the Council’s
resolutions are logical, wise and based on the lawful
principles that the Charter has laid down for the Council,
it should be clearly indicated, where the United Nations
Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) is concerned, that
the Council calls for cooperation and emphasizes the
issue of rebel groups in the Sudan.
