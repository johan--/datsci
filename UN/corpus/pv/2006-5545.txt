like to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of
the Council, to His Excellency Mr. Adamantios
Vassilakis, Permanent Representative of Greece, for his
service as President of the Security Council for the

members of the Council in expressing deep
appreciation to Ambassador Vassilakis for the great
diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council‚Äôs
