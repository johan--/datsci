(S/2005/158)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Burundi, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nkingiye
(Burundi) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now continue its consideration of the item
on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/158, which contains a letter dated
11 March 2005 from the Secretary-General addressed
to the President of the Security Council transmitting
the report of the assessment mission dispatched to
Burundi with the objective of considering the
advisability and feasibility of establishing an
international judicial commission of inquiry.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2005/396, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
