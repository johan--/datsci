Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
Mr. Owada (Japan): The Government of Japan is
deeply concerned about the recent deterioration of the
situation in Kosovo, which, tragically, has resulted in a
mounting death toll. Japan strongly condemns both the use
of excessive force by the Serbian police against civilians in
Kosovo and the use of violence, especially acts of
terrorism, by the Kosovo Liberation Army or anyone else
as a means to achieve political goals. My delegation
recognizes that the current situation in Kosovo poses a
threat to international peace and security in the region and
that the further spread of violence there might lead to the
destabilization of the entire Balkans.
Against this background, the draft resolution before us
is intended to send a clear and concerted message by the
Security Council that the parties concerned must stop this
violence in Kosovo in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and begin the process of finding a solution to the serious
political and human rights problems there. We are
convinced that this draft resolution, which includes a
decision to impose an arms embargo against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, will be, upon its
adoption, an effective instrument to prevent the further
spread of such violence.
The basic position of Japan on the problem of Kosovo,
which I believe it shares with the rest of the international
community, is that neither the repression of the human and
political rights of the Albanian population in Kosovo nor
the separation and independence of Kosovo is acceptable.
My Government urges the authorities in Belgrade and the
leadership of the Albanian community in Kosovo to
immediately enter into a substantive dialogue without
precondition, so that the citizens of Kosovo may enjoy a
sufficient degree of autonomy with meaningful self-
administration, as well as complete respect for their human
rights within the border of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. Japan is of the view that the participation of an
outside representative or representatives will be important
in order to ensure that such a dialogue can be promoted in
a meaningful way.
The Government of Japan fully supports the efforts of
the relevant international organizations and other bodies,
especially the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) and the Contact Group, in their cooperation
for the resolution of the crisis in Kosovo. My Government
urges the authorities in Belgrade to fully cooperate with the
OSCE and to take steps to implement without delay the
actions set out in the statement of the Contact Group of 9
March 1998. While my delegation recognizes that some
positive steps have been taken by the authorities in
Belgrade during the past few weeks, such as the
declaration of 18 March by the President of the Republic
of Serbia and the signature on 23 March of an agreement
to implement the 1996 Education Agreement, further
progress must be made without delay by the authorities of
both the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. At the same time, the Government of Japan
calls upon all elements of the Albanian community in
Kosovo to immediately accept the dialogue and to
categorically denounce terrorist activities and external
support for such activities.
For these reasons, my delegation will vote in favour
of the draft resolution now before us, which sets out in a
balanced manner all these points that I have emphasized
as important.
I should like to close my statement by expressing the
readiness of the Government of Japan to actively
participate in the efforts of the Security Council and of
the international community as a whole to assist in the
peaceful resolution of the crisis in Kosovo.
Mr. S√°enz Biolley (Costa Rica) (interpretation from
Spanish): In recent days we have witnessed, with deep
concern, extremely serious human rights violations in
Kosovo, which have led to the death of dozens of people
and deprived the inhabitants of the area of their basic
security. The increased violence in Kosovo has become
manifest in a variety of ways. On the one hand, the
Serbian police forces have used excessive and
unjustifiable force against peaceful demonstrators, and on
the other, acts of violence and reprehensible terrorist
attacks have been perpetrated. Those acts, in the context
of the very sensitive political and security balance in the
Balkans, constitute a clear threat to international peace
and security, which obligates the Council to take firm and
decisive action.
Respect for human rights constitutes a fundamental
value of the international community. As has been pointed
out by the International Court of Justice, their violation is
an offense against humankind as a whole. Thus Costa
Rica has always maintained that safeguarding human
rights is not solely and exclusively a matter of the internal
jurisdiction of States. On the contrary, Costa Rica
believes that respect for human rights, and the violation
of such rights, are matters of the utmost interest to the
international community.
In this connection, we believe that there are certain
circumstances in which a violation of such fundamental
3
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
rights is so serious that it constitutes, in and of itself, a
threat to international peace and security and therefore fully
justifies the Security Council's invoking the powers granted
to it under Chapter VII of the Charter.
We condemn terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations. Our position and actions, in the Security
Council and in the General Assembly, leave no room for
doubt on this score. However, combating terrorism does
not, as we see it, in any way justify human rights violations
or the failure to respect international humanitarian law.
Thus the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must, in the
specific case of Kosovo, respect the human rights of all of
its inhabitants, regardless of their ethnic origin or political
views. Likewise, it is imperative that it not allow the
recurrence of any excessive and unjustified acts of violence
by its police forces, that it prosecute the accused and that
it fully cooperate with the International Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia.
It is essential to begin a constructive dialogue with the
leaders of the Kosovar Albanian community in order to
resolve the political situation and allow for an appropriate
degree of autonomy. The authorities of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia must also allow humanitarian
organizations full access to the Kosovo region and facilitate
a mission of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights. These measures must be applied as soon as
possible. If the authorities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia failed to do so and continued to violate the
fundamental rights of the population, we would be
obligated to consider the imposition of additional measures
in order to compel them to change their illegal policies that
are contrary to the principles and obligations set forth in the
Charter.
Finally, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before us. We believe that imposing a prohibition
on the sale or supply of arms and other military equipment
to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the minimal
response the Security Council can provide at this time.
Mr. Dejammet (France)(interpretation from French):
The situation in Kosovo in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia calls for a response from the Security Council.
The tragic events that have marked the former Yugoslavia
in recent years have indeed demonstrated the need for a
rapid and appropriate response to crisis situations in the
region.
The States that make up what has been called the
Contact Group, as well as the European Union, the 26
countries that participated in the European conference
held in London and the neighbouring Balkan States, have
been involved since the beginning of the crisis. They have
emphasized the need for a cessation of violence and the
withdrawal of the special police forces, their
condemnation of terrorism and the importance of
achieving a political solution to the Kosovo crisis through
dialogue and with respect for the territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That solution should
include substantially greater autonomy for Kosovo.
During the London Contact Group meeting, on 9
March 1998, specific requirements were defined,
deadlines were set and measures for immediate
implementation were decided on. Meeting again on 25
March at Bonn, the States of the Contact Group noted
that progress had been achieved since the London
meeting.
The joint visit of the German and French Foreign
Ministers to Belgrade on 19 March made it possible to
appreciate positive developments in the position of the
authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The
agreement reached on 23 March between the parties
regarding measures to implement the 1996 Education
Agreement also demonstrates that it is possible to achieve
a negotiated solution to delicate issues.
That progress, however important, is still not
enough. Additional steps must be taken by the Belgrade
authorities and the representatives of the Kosovar
Albanians in order for substantive dialogue to commence
without preconditions.
The draft resolution before the Security Council
today is part of this context. By this draft resolution, the
Security Council would decide on an embargo on the sale
or supply of arms to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
including Kosovo. France already supports such a
measure, in accordance with the embargo decided on by
the European Union in 1991 and reconfirmed on 19
March 1998.
The measures stipulated in the draft resolution
should first and foremost be seen as a means to achieve
a negotiated settlement of the current crisis. The text
provides that the Security Council will review the
prohibitions that have been decided on and will be able to
lift them as soon as the Government of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia has met the conditions set out in
4
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
the draft resolution. The prohibitions can thus be lifted
when the Secretary-General, in one of the periodic reports
he must submit to the Security Council every 30 days,
deems that the Government of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia has fulfilled the specific requirements set by the
Security Council.
The draft resolution also provides that specific
progress on certain difficult issues related to Kosovo will
make it possible for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to
improve its prospects for normalizing its international
relations and for full participation in international
institutions.
My country therefore considers this draft resolution to
be a balanced text that can contribute to a peaceful political
settlement of the current crisis in Kosovo. That is why
France will vote in favour of the draft resolution.
Mr. Amolo (Kenya): The Kenya delegation wishes to
express its support for the draft resolution which is before
us today. We express grave concern about the recent violent
developments in Kosovo, and while appreciating that there
has been some progress in implementing the actions
outlined in the Contact Group statement of 9 March 1998,
a lot more dedicated work is required. The Kenya
delegation therefore calls upon the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and other parties to move expeditiously to
achieve a political solution to the issue of Kosovo through
dialogue. We also call upon the Kosovar Albanian
leadership to condemn all terrorist action and urge them to
pursue their political, social and economic goals by
peaceful means only.
We believe that the proliferation of arms and related
mat√©riel has exacerbated the already tense political and
security situation and believe that an arms embargo will
assist in fostering peace and stability in Kosovo. We
therefore call upon all States to strictly observe this
embargo. The draft resolution before us has a clear
mechanism for lifting this embargo, and we hope that the
clearly laid out conditions to enable this to happen will be
met sooner rather than later.
Mr. Lid√©n (Sweden): The situation in Kosovo remains
serious and clearly constitutes a threat to international peace
and security. We are pleased to see the Council today
discharging its duty in accordance with the Charter of the
United Nations in an effort to prevent a flare-up of new
armed violence in the Balkans. We will therefore welcome
the adoption of the draft resolution before us, imposing an
arms embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
including Kosovo. For Sweden, peace and stability in the
Balkans are necessary prerequisites for European security.
We condemn the excessive use of force by the
Serbian special police in Kosovo, which has caused
several deaths and injuries to unarmed civilians. We also
condemn all acts of terrorism. Both sides must exercise
restraint and enter into a serious political dialogue on how
to settle their differences through exclusively peaceful
means and on the basis of human rights and the rule of
law.
Sweden fully supports the declarations made by the
Contact Group ministers on 9 and 25 March in response
to the developments in Kosovo. We agree with the
measures recommended in order to persuade the
authorities in Belgrade to take necessary steps towards an
acceptable solution. It is also incumbent upon the Kosovar
Albanian leadership to act responsibly and facilitate the
beginning of a constructive dialogue.
While Belgrade has recently taken some positive
steps, much remains to be done. The concrete steps the
authorities in Belgrade must take are clearly spelt out in
paragraph 16 of the draft resolution. These steps include,
first, initiating a substantive dialogue on Kosovo with the
participation of an outside representative or
representatives; secondly, withdrawal of the special
police; thirdly, allowing access to Kosovo by
humanitarian organizations and others; fourthly, accepting
a mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union
representative, Mr. Felipe Gonz√°lez, as well as the return
of the OSCE long-term missions; and, fifthly, facilitating
a mission to Kosovo by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights.
Hopefully, Belgrade will listen to the international
community and take these steps, which would enable the
Council to reconsider the sanctions. Together with
progress in resolving human rights issues and in
cooperating with the International Tribunal, this would
also enhance the prospects for the normalization of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia‚Äôs international relations,
which we look forward to. If Belgrade does not comply,
however, additional measures will be considered.
The arms embargo that we are about to impose must
be immediately and strictly implemented by all States. As
a member of the European Union, Sweden has already
decided to implement not only the arms embargo but also
the other sanctions recommended by the Contact Group,
5
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
including refusal to supply equipment which can be used
for internal repression or for terrorism, denial of visas for
officials responsible for the repression and a moratorium on
Government-financed export credits.
Finally, let me say that Sweden concurs with the
statement that the United Kingdom is going to make on
behalf of the European Union.
Mr. Valle (Brazil): Given the tragic background of
inter-ethnic violence in the recent history of the Balkans,
the international community has not been unjustified in
reacting with disquiet to the recent events in the Kosovo
region of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I do not wish
to minimize the complex threats to internal security posed
by clandestine terrorist activity, but the fact remains that the
repressive measures taken against civilians in Kosovo by
Serbian police forces have provoked indignation throughout
the world.
Significantly, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the
countries of South-Eastern Europe, meeting in Sofia on
March 10, circulated a declaration expressing their
‚Äúconcern with the deteriorating situation in Kosovo
and with the grave consequences of an inter-ethnic
conflict and its possible spillover in the region.‚Äù
In addition to the Sofia meeting, there have been a
number of important encounters and declarations dealing
with these new episodes of Balkan instability, which have
all seemed to converge towards the need for the
international community to avoid the mistakes of the past
by articulating a quick and effective response which will
help stem the violence and create the conditions for
improved dialogue and cooperation between the parties.
We have welcomed the many joint and individual
diplomatic initiatives taken by those who would be
potentially most affected by a new wave of unrest in the
Balkans, and have remained attentive to their strategies for
dealing with what might best be described as a very
delicate situation. It is from this intense diplomatic
mobilization that a decision has seemed to emerge in favour
of an arms embargo, as a measure capable of putting
pressure on the parties to negotiate while placing a limit on
the presence of weapons in an already heavily armed and
volatile region.
As a matter of principle, it has seemed important for
my delegation to emphasize the need for clear provisions
regarding the conditions for lifting the sanctions in the draft
before us. We note that paragraph 16 addresses this
problem in a manner which we consider satisfactory,
although we would stress the need for the Secretary-
General to base the assessments he is to make under that
paragraph on as wide a spectrum of information as
possible, and in close cooperation with the region, the
countries which meet as the Contact Group ‚Äî France,
Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United
Kingdom and the United States ‚Äî the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe and the European
Union.
While concurring with the imposition of an embargo,
we cannot fail to stress that these measures will not yield
the desired effect if they are not accompanied by parallel
diplomatic efforts aimed at the promotion of a safer and
more harmonious environment for those who have been
most directly affected by the unrest.
Furthermore, if there is movement in a positive
direction, the Security Council should acknowledge it
promptly. The declaration by the President of the
Republic of Serbia on the political process in Kosovo has
been received by the international community as an
auspicious sign. In the face of further and sustained
progress, there should be no reason to doubt that the
Security Council will respond accordingly. At this stage
we should confine ourselves to the measures contained in
the draft, in the expectation that developments will render
needless the consideration of additional restrictions.
Although the Charter enshrines the principle of non-
intervention in matters which are essentially within the
domestic jurisdiction of any State, we are all aware that
this principle does not prejudice the application of
enforcement measures under Chapter VII, in accordance
with Article 2, paragraph 7. Perhaps it is not by
coincidence that the proliferation of decisions authorized
by the Security Council under Chapter VII since the end
of the cold war, and of sanctions in particular, has come
about in a world where conflict has often seemed to break
out within the internal borders of States. Some observers
have gone as far as to suggest that there may have been
a tendency to frame emergencies under Chapter VII in
recent years so as to circumvent the non-intervention
principle. If this were indeed the case, we would be
witnessing a distortion in the waiver provided by Article
2, paragraph 7, which would seem to be incompatible
with its original purpose.
On the other hand, as stated in General Assembly
resolution 51/242, annex II, on the question of sanctions
6
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
imposed by the United Nations, sanctions are a matter of
the utmost seriousness and concern. That text, adopted by
consensus, declares in paragraph 1 that
‚ÄúSanctions should be resorted to only with the utmost
caution, when other peaceful options provided by the
Charter are inadequate.‚Äù
By concluding my statement with these references to
an important General Assembly resolution and to the United
Nations Charter, I wish to emphasize my delegation‚Äôs
commitment to the pacific settlement of disputes within a
context of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.
We believe that by exercising caution in resorting to
coercive measures we are actually strengthening the
authority of the Security Council in the face of serious and
otherwise intractable situations.
Mr. T√ºrk (Slovenia): The Security Council is opening
a new and potentially important chapter in its effort to
maintain peace and security in the Balkans. The situation in
Kosovo in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has the
potential for serious destabilization in the region. On the
other hand, if managed towards a genuine political solution
it could represent an important building block in the
structure of security and political stability in the Balkans.
Today both options are open, and the future depends not
only on the action of those directly involved but also on the
international community as a whole, including the Security
Council. The accuracy of political analysis and assessment
and the correct choice of the first steps are of critical
importance.
There are, in our opinion, three essential political
lessons, based upon recent experience and common sense,
which need to be borne in mind while approaching the
issue of Kosovo.
First, there is no reason to expect quick fixes. The
situation is difficult and the capacities for a quick political
settlement limited. Kosovo is one of those places where
history has cast some of its longest and darkest shadows.
Too much violence and too little readiness for genuine
compromise have characterized the situation for years.
However, it would be wrong to conclude that violence
will be inevitable in the future. Much will depend on the
ability of the international actors to guide future
developments towards genuine political solutions. These
solutions will have to include arrangements that will satisfy
the needs of both the Albanian majority population and the
Serb population in Kosovo. While the path to success could
be long and exhausting, it is important that the right steps
be taken from the beginning.
Secondly, the principles upon which the solutions are
sought should be sufficiently broad and sufficiently
fundamental. It is essential that the political process be
started on the basis of broad and fundamental principles
of the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki
Final Act of 1975. These principles include everything
that is essential. Moreover, they are not constrained by
the specificities that are meant for other types of
situations and that characterize some of the more recent
international instruments.
Let me give an example. A range of recent
instruments on the rights of persons belonging to various
kinds of minorities does not seem particularly useful in
the process of searching for a potential political solution
for Kosovo, except, of course, to the extent that the
parties directly involved recognize them as useful. Let us
not forget that not long ago Kosovo enjoyed a degree of
autonomy that far exceeded the limits set out in some
recent instruments on the rights of minorities ‚Äî that is,
instruments that were developed for situations different
from and easier than that of Kosovo.
Thirdly, it is essential to ensure that intellectual and
moral accuracy prevail in the international efforts to help
resolve the situation. It is extremely important that the
problems at hand are defined accurately and honestly. The
degree to which the issues are used for other political
reasons besides the search for solutions needs to be
conscientiously reduced to the minimum.
In the past, the unilateral dismantling of Kosovo's
autonomy represented one of the major sources of
political deterioration and instability in the region. At
present, the use of force against the Albanians of Kosovo
represents the most important source of instability and a
threat to international peace and security. Consequently,
efforts must be directed towards the elimination of that
threat. The attempts to obscure that threat by various
techniques of what commentators call ‚Äúan even
distribution of guilt‚Äù ‚Äî techniques that were amply on
display in international discussions on some other
situations in the recent past ‚Äî would again bring only
harm and suffering and would delay the solutions. The
techniques of ‚Äúan even distribution of guilt‚Äù say little
about the actual facts of the situation concerned and speak
volumes about the lack of agreement at the level of the
international community. What is needed is the clear
7
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
identification of facts and a responsible judgement
regarding their consequences.
In this context, I wish to refer to a specific question
that requires attention at this stage, namely, the issue of
terrorism and the danger of political misuse of the word
‚Äúterrorism‚Äù. There is a clear need to avoid the trap set by
those who use the label of terrorism for reasons of political
convenience and without proper factual foundation.
It is clear that violent acts, such as the taking of
hostages, attacks against the safety of civilian air traffic,
terrorist bombings and other attacks against civilian targets
are properly defined as terrorism. And it is clear that
terrorism has to be condemned and combated.
On the other hand, however, there are forms of
struggle that, albeit undesirable, are not terrorism and ought
not to be labelled as such. This is particularly relevant to
the situation in Kosovo, where the characteristics of an
armed conflict have, unfortunately, already assumed serious
proportions.
Permit me now to make a few observations on the text
of the draft resolution submitted to the Security Council for
action today.
The situation in Kosovo has been giving rise to
legitimate international concern for quite some time now.
Thus, it can no longer be described as an internal affair.
Serious violations of human rights have been reported for
years, and the use of force in recent weeks has triggered a
wave of expressions of concern from the neighbouring
States and the international community at large.
Slovenia shares the concern expressed at the meetings
of the Contact Group in London on 9 March 1998 and in
Bonn on 25 March 1998. Moreover, we generally agree
with the decisions taken at those meetings, including the
decisions regarding action by the Security Council. Such
action is necessary since the situation in Kosovo has
already developed into a threat to international peace and
security in the region. This is the reason for action based on
Chapter VII of the Charter, as envisaged in the draft
resolution.
Slovenia supports the draft resolution as proposed by
the sponsors and will vote in favour of it. The draft
resolution contains important elements, including the
prevention of the flow of arms to the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. The draft resolution represents an additional
piece in the mosaic of international pressure on the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to start immediately and without
conditions serious negotiations on the final status of
Kosovo. The draft resolution should demonstrate the
determination of the international community that this is
the time to act and to prevent a massive humanitarian
tragedy and the outbreak of war.
The draft resolution condemns the recent violence in
Kosovo, which resulted in numerous fatalities among
innocent civilians.
The draft resolution calls upon both sides ‚Äî namely,
the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
the leadership of the Kosovar Albanians to enter without
preconditions into a meaningful dialogue on an enhanced
status for Kosovo, which would include a substantially
greater degree of autonomy and meaningful self-
administration.
The draft resolution imposes an embargo on the sale
and supply to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ‚Äî
including, but not only, Kosovo ‚Äî of arms and related
mat√©riel of all types. It provides clear conditions for the
lifting of the embargo, as well as additional measures in
case of failure to make constructive progress towards a
peaceful resolution.
The draft resolution also notes that possible concrete
progress to resolve the crisis in Kosovo could improve the
prospects for participation of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in international institutions. It goes without
saying that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia could
participate in the work of those institutions only in
accordance with the rules and decisions of those
institutions, including the ones applicable to new
members. It should be recalled that the current non-
participation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in
international institutions is largely a consequence of its
unwillingness to apply for membership.
A solution to the Kosovo crisis can be found only by
the parties themselves ‚Äî but not by themselves alone.
The animosities between them and tensions in the broader
region are already too high. The international community
should help the parties by applying pressure and by
providing mediation during the forthcoming negotiations.
The efforts of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Personal
Representative of the Chairman-in-Office are supported
also by the Security Council in this draft resolution.
8
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
The success of the draft resolution submitted for
action today should be assessed on how it will, together
with other measures and actions by other international and
regional institutions, succeed in leading to serious progress
in negotiations on the final status of Kosovo; deterring the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from using force again in
Kosovo and encouraging it, rather, to make use of peaceful
means to solve the problems; and giving the Albanians
much-needed confidence in the efforts of the international
community.
The present draft resolution can be a step in the right
direction. The Security Council should very soon be ready
to evaluate its real effects and those of the specific
measures envisaged in it. It is known from recent
experience that the political message of an arms embargo
may not be properly understood and that the application of
the embargo may leave much to be desired. Therefore, the
Security Council should remain actively seized of the
matter in an effort to help resolve the situation and to
maintain peace and security in the region.
Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (interpretation from Arabic):
My delegation wishes at the outset to convey its
appreciation of the efforts made by the sponsors of today's
draft resolution on Kosovo. We would have preferred the
concerns we expressed during consultations to have been
taken into account. Yet, in a spirit of cooperation, my
delegation did not wish to obstruct the work of the Council
or to stand in the way of unanimity, even though we
believe that those concerns are legitimate.
Recently the Kosovo region has been the scene of
bloody violence against the Albanian community, which
constitutes more than 90 per cent of the population there.
This violence has resulted in the death of many innocent
people, including children and women. We feel great
sadness and sorrow for these victims and condemn the
savagery with which this matter has been handled. We also
condemn the practices of the Serbian authorities against
unarmed civilian inhabitants of the Kosovo region, the
arbitrary measures and the discriminatory practices
employed against them, including imprisonment.
There have been substantial international and regional
attempts to urge the Serbian Government to act with
restraint and to begin a serious, unconditional political
dialogue with the Kosovar Albanians. In this regard, the
Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia have exerted
strenuous efforts to resolve this crisis. Some of the Contact
Group Foreign Ministers visited Belgrade seeking to
convince the Government there to settle the crisis
peacefully. But the Belgrade Government has persisted in
rejecting all these attempts and has persevered in its
intransigence.
With a view to preventing another massacre, like
that which took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
Security Council acted swiftly; several consultation
meetings and other contacts took place, resulting in the
draft resolution before us today, which we hope will send
a clear message from the international community to the
authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
In the context of attempts to settle the problem, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, at the twenty-
fifth meeting of Foreign Ministers that took place at
Doha, Qatar, from 15 to 17 March 1998, expressed its
concern at the grave violations of the human and political
rights of the inhabitants of the Kosovo region. The
Organization of the Islamic Conference emphasized its
rejection of the arbitrary use of armed force against
civilians in Kosovo. It also called for an immediate halt
to such actions and for an immediate withdrawal from
civilian areas. The Organization of the Islamic Conference
also adopted a resolution calling upon its Secretary-
General to hold consultations with other relevant
international organizations with a view to managing the
Kosovo crisis. It also called for the establishment of
genuine institutions in Kosovo, as the best way of
protecting the human, political and national rights of the
population of the region, and of preventing the escalation
of violence there. It further called for the reopening of all
educational, cultural and scientific institutions, and for
internationally protected dialogue with the Kosovo
population.
The draft resolution before the Council today is but
an initial message to the Belgrade Government. We hope
that that Government will reconsider all its actions and
past policies with respect to the Kosovo region. We hope
that that Government will respond positively to the call of
the international community, which in paragraph 3 of the
draft resolution before us would clearly call for offering
the Kosovar Albanian community a genuine political
process; we hope that this will lead to a settlement
acceptable to both sides.
The Government of Bahrain supports draft resolution
S/1998/284 and will vote in favour of it.
Mr. Soares (Portugal): Our deep concern at the
situation in Kosovo cannot be overstated. Not only are
issues of political and human rights at stake, but
9
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
instability in Kosovo also threatens international peace and
security in the region. The international community should
send an unambiguous signal of its concern and should unite
in its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution on
Kosovo.
We therefore fully support the role assumed by the
Contact Group in defining an action plan to end the
violence in Kosovo and to bring about a political solution
through unconditional dialogue, as set out in the statements
issued by Contact Group Foreign Ministers at London on 9
March and at Bonn on 25 March. Consequently, we
strongly support the draft resolution before the Council
today, which would establish an arms embargo on the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The goal of the draft
resolution is clear: to end the violence both by the security
forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and by
terrorists, and to promote a meaningful process of
unconditional dialogue with the leadership of the Kosovar
Albanian community.
This unconditional dialogue should be oriented
towards giving Kosovo a substantially greater degree of
autonomy, including meaningful self-administration. The
outcome of the dialogue should not be predetermined, and
it should be based on the territorial integrity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as on the principles of the
Helsinki Final Act adopted by the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe and of the United Nations
Charter.
Let us be clear: we support neither independence nor
the status quo. We call on the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Kosovar Albanian community to
renounce violence and to pursue this dialogue and reach a
mutually acceptable agreement. We utterly condemn the use
of force by either side.
An important step towards a process of dialogue has
been the agreement on measures to implement the 1996
Education Agreement. We urge that this be followed
through effectively.
The role of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in bringing about an
acceptable resolution on Kosovo is equally important, and
we urge the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to cooperate
fully with the Personal Representative of Chairman-in-
Office of OSCE and Special Representative of the
European Union, Mr. Felipe Gonzalez, and to allow the
return of the long-term OSCE mission.
We hope that the arms embargo the Council is
establishing today will not be in place for long. It is in
the best interests of all concerned that swift measures be
taken to initiate the peaceful dialogue to which I have
referred. We trust that this opportunity will be seized.
In conclusion, I wish also to say that as a member
of the European Union, Portugal's position on the matter
before the Council today is fully reflected in the statement
to be made by the representative of the United Kingdom
on behalf of the European Union.
Mr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (interpretation
from Russian): From the very outset, the Russian
Federation has viewed the recent events in Kosovo as the
internal affair of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We
strongly believe that the basic principle for a settlement
of the situation in Kosovo is that that autonomous region
must remain within Serbia on the basis of unswerving
compliance with the principle of the territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and of the republics
that make it up.
Only within this legal framework is an effective
settlement of the Kosovo problem possible through
peaceful political dialogue without preconditions or
unilateral approaches. It is precisely in support of such a
political process that the decisions of the international
Contact Group, adopted at London and Bonn, are
directed.
While we condemn the use of excessive force by the
Serbian police, we also strongly condemn any terrorist
acts on the part of the Kosovar Albanians, including the
so-called the Kosovo Liberation Army, and other
manifestations of extremism, which seriously destabilize
the situation and complicate the search for a mutually
acceptable and effective political settlement of the
situation. This approach is based on a key principle of
Russian foreign policy: Terrorism is categorically
unacceptable in any form or manifestation and calls for
the most decisive condemnation of the international
community. Clearly, any foreign support for terrorism
must be nipped in the bud, which requires a coordinated
international effort.
Unfortunately, the events in Kosovo have an adverse
regional impact. At the same time, the situation in
Kosovo, despite its complexity, does not constitute a
threat to regional, much less international peace and
security. It is precisely this understanding that is reflected
in the draft resolution before us today.
10
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
It was extremely difficult for Russia to agree with
such a measure as the introduction of a military embargo.
We embarked on this step only on the understanding ‚Äî
which is now embedded in the draft resolution ‚Äî that the
issue is not about punishing anyone, Belgrade in particular,
but about specific measures designed to prevent an increase
in tensions, to erect an obstacle to external terrorism, and
to foster the political process with a view to a speedy and
lasting settlement. The prospects for such a settlement
depend on the political will and willingness to take a
constructive approach of both sides ‚Äî the Serbian
leadership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
Kosovar Albanians.
One of the most important conditions for the viability
of the embargo is an effective monitoring regime for its
implementation, particularly on the Albanian-Macedonian
border. The illegal arms traffic must be reliably impeded
and mere declarations on that subject do not suffice. It is
precisely from this perspective that we must consider the
mandate of the United Nations Preventive Deployment
Force. It may be useful in this context for the Secretary-
General, in preparing the reports contemplated in the draft
resolution, to conduct investigations on the supply of
weapons, training, and financial and other support for the
Kosovo terrorists from the territories of neighbouring and
other countries.
Russia‚Äôs position has been and continues to be that the
Security Council‚Äôs establishment of a military embargo, like
any military sanctions, is possible only with a clear exit
strategy. In the future, we will continue to advocate the
need to limit the sanctions with a clear schedule, following
the expiration of which the Council will have to decide
whether or not the sanctions should be extended.
Unfortunately, our approach has not, for the time
being, received sufficient support in the Security Council.
Nevertheless, the draft resolution has been able to define
strict criteria; if Belgrade complies with these, the Security
Council will decide to lift the embargo. We note that the
Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
Serbia have already taken important steps in that direction.
They have announced the withdrawal of police units; the
International Committee of the Red Cross and other
humanitarian organizations have been given access to
Kosovo; the President of Serbia, Mr. Milutinovic¬¥, officially
announced his readiness for a political dialogue with the
Kosovar Albanians, without preconditions. We encourage
Belgrade to intensify these positive efforts.
As the draft resolution confirms, concrete progress
to resolve the issues relating to the situation in Kosovo
will improve the international position of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and prospects for normalization
of its full participation in international institutions. Russia
sincerely hopes that this will happen as soon as possible.
It is also important that the draft resolution clearly
links the restrictions it imposes to existing agreements in
the region on the levels of armaments, inter alia, the
Florence Agreement on Subregional Arms Control.
We see the main task of the international community
to be the full promotion of the consolidation of progress
made in the situation around Kosovo. This must not be
done by increasing sanction measures, which may have
the most adverse repercussions for the entire Balkan
region and many other States besides. The efforts of all
interested countries and international organizations must
be directed to encouraging and supporting the political
process, fostering dialogue to the greatest extent possible,
and preventing any deterioration of the situation. Russia
will continue to work precisely to that end.
Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (interpretation from
Chinese): The Chinese delegation is concerned about the
current situation in Kosovo, in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. Kosovo is an integral part of the territory of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The question of
Kosovo is, in its essence, an internal matter of the Federal
Republic. It should be resolved properly through
negotiations between both parties concerned on the basis
of the principle of respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
We have noted that the Government of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia has taken a series of positive
measures in this regard and that the situation on the
ground is moving towards stability. We do not think that
the situation in Kosovo endangers regional and
international peace and security.
Ethnic issues are extremely complicated and
sensitive, especially in the Balkans. On the one hand, the
legitimate rights and interests of all ethnic groups should
be protected; on the other, secessionist activities by
various extremist elements should be prevented.
Many countries in the region are multiethnic. If the
Council is to get involved in a dispute without a request
from the country concerned, it may set a bad precedent
11
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
and have wider negative implications. Therefore, the
Council should be cautious when addressing these issues.
The priority issue in solving the question of Kosovo
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is for the parties to
start the political talks as soon as possible. However, the
draft resolution before us would not help move the parties
to negotiations. Furthermore, it is neither appropriate to
bring before the Council the differences between the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as the human
rights issues in Kosovo, nor proper to link the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia‚Äôs return to the international
community with the question of Kosovo.
The Chinese delegation has stated its principled
position repeatedly in the Council‚Äôs consultations. Since the
contents of the draft resolution do not conform to our
principled position, we have no choice but to abstain in the
voting. The Chinese delegation requests that its position be
placed on record.
The President: I now put to the vote the draft
resolution contained in document S/1998/284.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bahrain, Brazil, Costa Rica, France, Gabon, Gambia,
Japan, Kenya, Portugal, Russian Federation, Slovenia,
Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America
Against:
None
Abstaining:
China
The President: The result of the voting is as follows:
14 votes in favour, none against and 1 abstention. The draft
resolution has been adopted as resolution 1160 (1998).
I shall now call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements following the voting.
Mr. Richmond (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom shares the deep concern expressed around this
table about the violence and bloodshed which, in recent
weeks, have once again visited this troubled part of the
world. The resolution which the Council has adopted today
is one element in a concerted international effort to prevent
a repetition in Kosovo of the cycle of violence we have
already seen elsewhere in the region.
On 9 March the United Kingdom hosted a meeting
of Foreign Ministers of Contact Group countries in
London. The Group agreed a plan of action aimed at
putting a stop to further violence and paving the way for
a serious political dialogue between the authorities in
Belgrade and representatives of the Kosovar Albanian
community.
Meeting again in Bonn on 25 March, the Contact
Group concluded that while there had been some progress
in the intervening period, included the belated agreement
to implement the 1996 Education Agreement, the steps
taken by the Belgrade authorities towards meeting the
requirements set out in London did not go far enough.
In adopting this resolution, the Security Council
sends an unmistakable message: that by acting under
Chapter VII of the Charter, the Council considers that the
situation in Kosovo constitutes a threat to international
peace and security in the Balkans region. It says to
Belgrade that repression in Kosovo will not be tolerated
by the international community; and to the Kosovar side,
it says that terrorism ‚Äî in whatever guise and for
whatever purpose ‚Äî is unacceptable.
The United Kingdom‚Äôs record against terrorism is
firm. But terrorism cannot be a pretext for the use of
force against a civilian population. Belgrade cannot pass
off the repressive acts of recent weeks as purely an
internal affair. Human rights abuses are a matter for us
all. And we have a particular responsibility to reduce
tension in the region before it causes instability in
neighbouring countries.
The United Kingdom does not support separatism or
independence in Kosovo. But we expect Belgrade to grant
Kosovo an enhanced status including self-administration.
Getting the authorities in Belgrade and the Kosovar
Albanian community to start a constructive dialogue
without preconditions about the differences between them
is the only chance of reaching a peaceful settlement.
Repressive police actions of the kind we have witnessed
in recent weeks serve merely to undermine the moderates
on both sides and to increase support for terrorists.
The United Kingdom looks forward to the day when
we can welcome the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into
the family of democratic nations of Europe. But we
cannot do so while Belgrade fails to meet the standards
12
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
that the rest of Europe has set itself. President Milosevic
has a choice: he must decide whether he wishes to consign
the future of his State and its people to further isolation and
mounting international pressure, or whether he wants to see
progress in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia‚Äôs relations
with the European Union and the rest of the international
community of the kind already being made by its
neighbours.
Mr. Richardson (United States of America): Today
the Security Council is taking a clear stand for peace and
security in the Balkans. The United States strongly supports
this resolution imposing an arms embargo on the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. In so doing, the Council sends an
unambiguous message that the international community will
not tolerate violence and ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù in the region of
the former Yugoslavia. We must avoid the mistakes of the
past, when the international community waited too long
before taking decisive action. We fully recognize that the
security of the region directly affects broader international
interests and that deterioration of the situation in Kosovo
constitutes a threat to international peace and security.
Over the last few years, this Council and the
international community have worked hard to promote
ethnic reconciliation in Bosnia and Croatia. The United
States and our partners in the peace effort must not now
watch years of peace-building in the Balkans destroyed by
repressive violence or by terrorist activity in Kosovo.
The Foreign Ministers of the Contact Group, meeting
in London on March 9 and in Bonn on March 25, agreed
that the situation in Kosovo is not simply an internal
matter, but also has a direct impact on the stability of
neighbouring countries and jeopardizes peace in the
Balkans. As Secretary Albright said in Bonn, the
international community has not faced a problem in the
former Yugoslavia as dangerous as the situation in Kosovo
since the last war in the region began.
President Milosevic knows what he must do to have
the arms embargo and other sanctions lifted and to avoid
further measures. As a necessary and crucial step, President
Milosevic must begin an unconditional dialogue on political
status issues with the Kosovar Albanian leadership. The
United States joins the Council in expressing support for an
enhanced status for Kosovo, including greater autonomy
and meaningful self-administration. The United States
believes this is the only way to achieve long-term peace
and a satisfactory resolution to the conflict in the region.
The United States strongly welcomes the clear
commitment of Mr. Rugova and other senior
representatives of the Kosovar Albanian leadership to
non-violence and a negotiated solution to the crisis in
Kosovo. We will not countenance terrorist activity or
external support for terrorist activity. The Kosovar
Albanian community should pursue their goals through
peaceful means.
This resolution also underlines the important role of
the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Tribunal
in gathering evidence about the violence in Kosovo which
may fall within its jurisdiction. We remind the authorities
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of their obligation
to extend full cooperation in this effort, as well as of their
commitments under the Bosnia peace agreement to
cooperate fully with the International Tribunal.
Of key importance is urgent action by the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to stop the violence and other
provocative action by its police and paramilitary security
forces. In spite of assurances by the authorities to the
contrary, these special police remain in Kosovo in force.
They must be withdrawn immediately, in keeping with the
London Contact Group statement. Civilians and members
of the international community, including international
humanitarian workers in the region, have been harassed,
threatened, arrested and even beaten by these police.
We believe that only sustained international pressure
will ensure continued progress towards the goal of a
peacefully negotiated solution in Kosovo. This resolution
confirms that the international community will hold
President Milosevic¬¥ firmly to meeting in full the
benchmarks of the London Contact Group. Otherwise, as
the Bonn Contact Group recognized, additional measures
may be needed.
The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as representative of the Gambia.
The recent events in Kosovo, Serbia, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia have been a great concern the
world over. These events prompted the Security Council
some weeks ago to request its President to make a
statement to the press expressing serious concern over the
situation in Kosovo and calling on the parties to exercise
utmost restraint and to enter into serious political
dialogue. The situation in Kosovo did not witness any
concrete progress after that statement was made.
13
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
Although progress has been made in the
implementation of the actions indicated by the Contact
Group in its statement of 9 March 1998, my delegation
believes that there is still more to be done, as the situation
still remains precarious.
In this context, my delegation welcomes and supports
the signature on 23 March 1998 of the 1996 Education
Agreement. It is imperative that this Agreement be
implemented fully and in accordance with the agreed
timetable.
My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to thank
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) and the Contact Group for their relentless efforts
to bring about a solution to the problem in Kosovo. We
therefore urge them to continue the good work.
The Contact Group is offering a diplomatic and
political opportunity for the solution of the problems in
Kosovo. The parties should give diplomacy a chance and
take advantage of the window of opportunity opened for
them by the OSCE.
It is my delegation‚Äôs belief that the situation there
cannot be settled without meaningful dialogue between the
parties to resolve their differences. Resort to the use of
force, unprovoked violence and terrorism are no answer to
their problems. Political problems should be solved
politically. The use of force, more often than not, further
exacerbates a problem and produces compliance based on
a fragile foundation. My delegation therefore calls on the
parties to exercise utmost restraint and work out measures
to find a political solution to this problem.
My delegation notes with appreciation the claimed
commitment of the senior representatives of the Kosovar
Albanian community to non-violence. My delegation hopes
that the same can be said of the Serbian Government.
However, the availability of arms and other military
mat√©riel to parties in a conflict usually leads the parties to
armed confrontation. It is noted with disapproval that such
is the case in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. My
delegation would therefore support the measures contained
in the resolution. It is our view that the lack of access by
the parties to military mat√©riel would reduce their capability
to fight and, hence, the incidence of violence. In that
context, my delegation welcomes the establishment of a
Committee to monitor the implementation of the measures
contained in the resolution and urges all States to respect
them.
While the Council considers an arms embargo on the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, to be
a necessary step to halt the continued degeneration of the
situation in Kosovo, this move alone is not sufficient to
change the situation. The parties to the conflict should be
genuinely committed to working out a diplomatic
solution. My delegation recognizes that the prospects for
such an achievement could be elusive if a genuine
political process acceptable to both sides is not put in
place.
Finally, my delegation wishes once more to urge the
parties to find a political compromise and also to respect
the provisions of the resolution we have adopted today. In
this way, what may appear to be an insurmountable
problem would in fact turn out to be the opposite.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.
I call on the representative of the United Kingdom.
Mr. Richmond (United Kingdom): I would like to
make a statement on behalf of the European Union. The
Central and Eastern European countries associated with
the European Union ‚Äî the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland and Romania ‚Äî as well as the European Free
Trade Association country, Norway, a member of the
European Economic Area, align themselves with this
statement.
The European Union is deeply concerned at the
threat to regional peace and security posed by the
situation in Kosovo. The international community must
send a clear message to the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Serbian authorities that the excessive
violence by military police units, involving deaths and
injury among the civilian population, is unacceptable.
Equally, we condemn unreservedly all terrorist acts and
call on those supplying financial support, arms or training
to cease to do so. We urge both sides to engage
immediately in genuine and unconditional dialogue,
including with the participation of an outside
representative.
The European Union fully supports the statement
made by the Contact Group Foreign Ministers in Bonn on
25 March. It endorses their assessment that while some
positive developments have occurred ‚Äî notably the deal
on the implementation of the Education Agreement, which
is a particularly welcome step forward ‚Äî progress has
not been sufficient to meet the requirements set out by the
14
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
meeting of Contact Group Foreign Ministers in London on
9 March.
The European Union has nominated Mr. Felipe
Gonz√°lez as European Union Special Representative, with
a view to enhancing the effectiveness of the European
Union‚Äôs contribution to resolving the problems in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, and the
European Union strongly supports the mission by
Mr. Gonz√°lez as Personal Representative of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
Chairman-in-Office for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The European Union believes that pressure must be
maintained to bring the Belgrade authorities to the
negotiating table. That means implementing forthwith the
measures agreed at the London Contact Group meeting.
Against this background, the European Union strongly
supports the resolution which has just been adopted by the
Council. The Union already has a comprehensive arms
embargo in place against the countries of the former
Yugoslavia. We wish to see all other Member States taking
an equally stringent position. This resolution is an
expression of the international community‚Äôs rejection of the
policy of violence, whether carried out by military police or
by terrorists.
It is essential also that the international response to the
crisis be a united and coherent one. We know, to our cost,
from the early days of the Bosnian war, that international
divisions undermine our efforts. The resolution we have
adopted today sends a powerful signal to the authorities in
Belgrade that the international community is united in its
desire to see real progress on Kosovo and is monitoring
events there closely. Neighbouring States have already
expressed concern that further turmoil in Kosovo might
spread instability beyond the borders of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. We owe it to them to take a firm
line.
The European Union favours granting a large degree
of autonomy to Kosovo within the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. This must include meaningful self-
administration for the local population. But the key is
getting both sides to talk, and we will support a settlement
on Kosovo‚Äôs status reached by mutual agreement.
The President: In accordance with the decision taken
earlier in the meeting, I now invite Mr. Jovanovic¬¥ to take
a seat at the Council table and to make a statement.
Mr. Jovanovic¬¥: At the very outset, let me eliminate
every risk of perceptive mistakes: Kosovo and Metohija
is a Serbian province that has always been, and is today,
an integral part of the Republic of Serbia. That territory
has never been part of any other State. It is the cradle of
the Serbian State, one of the oldest European States, the
birthplace of Serbian culture and civilization.
Besides the Serbs and Montenegrins, and besides the
members of the Albanian national minority, members of
other national minorities and ethnic communities ‚Äî such
as Muslims, numbering over 150,000; Romanies,
numbering 150,000; Turks, Croats and others ‚Äî have for
centuries also lived in Kosovo and Metohija.
Under the constitution and laws, all of them are
granted the same civil and human rights: to their
language, culture, media and religion; to elect and to be
elected; and to participate in genuine political processes,
from self-rule to republican and federal parliaments. All
these rights are based on the highest European standards,
including the standards of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe
Framework Convention.
The members of the Albanian national minority are
granted the same rights that are granted to other citizens.
However, whereas all other citizens exercise their rights,
a large part of the Albanian national minority boycott
some of those rights ‚Äî under pressure from and because
of blackmail by their separatist representatives ‚Äî and
exercise others. For instance, they boycott municipal and
local elections, the official census and political
institutions, yet they are very active in exercising the right
to private property, pensions and social benefits and the
right to employment, passports, freedom of movement and
private enterprise. The exercise of the right to
information, for instance, is attested to by the fact that
over 50 private dailies, weeklies and periodicals are
printed in the Albanian language, the aggregate circulation
of which amounts to 2.5 million copies.
The selective boycott of some, and the exercise of
other, rights is not the result of the free will of the
members of the Albanian national minority, most of
whom are responsible, loyal and law-abiding citizens. It
is the result of pressure and blackmail by some leaders of
the political parties in Kosovo and Metohija whose public
programme is secession from Serbia. Terrorist actions, the
killing of Albanians loyal to Serbia, the assassination of
public officials, attacks on public institutions and the
ambushing of police officers such as took place on 28
15
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
February 1998, when four policemen were killed, are
designed to intimidate ethnic Albanians into closing ranks,
increase tension, attract the attention of the international
public and ‚Äúsubstantiate‚Äù the requests for mediation and
internationalization. The ultimate goal is the secession of
this Serbian land from Serbia. Simply put, Serbia cannot
and will not allow that to happen under any conditions.
I trust and believe that it is apparent that the problems
in Kosovo and Metohija are rooted in a separatism which,
at this very moment, is publicly advocated by the
representatives of some political parties of the Albanian
national minority. This underpins terrorism, which has so
far claimed dozens of human lives. It is the right of every
State to defend itself from this evil, to protect its territorial
integrity, public peace and order and the safety of its
citizens. This right is not denied anywhere in the world and
it cannot be denied to Serbia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
Today‚Äôs meeting of the Security Council and the
adoption of a resolution are not acceptable to the
Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, since
questions that represent an internal matter for Serbia and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are at stake. We
consider that this internal question cannot be the subject of
deliberation in any international forum without the consent
of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Such consent has not been granted.
The pretext for this unprecedented action by the
Security Council has been found in two anti-terrorist police
actions in Kosovo and Metohija, the autonomous province
of Serbia. The first was carried out on 28 February in self
defence following the killing of four police officers in an
ambush, and the second was carried out on 5 March against
a terrorist stronghold.
There is not, nor has there been, any armed conflict in
Kosovo and Metohija. Hence, there is no danger of a
spillover, there is no threat to peace and security and there
is no basis for invoking Chapter VII of the Charter of the
United Nations.
There have been many much larger instances all over
the world of not only police, but also military action against
terrorists in which civilians have been frequent victims. Yet
neither the Security Council nor any other international
forum has ever seen fit to raise, in any way whatever, the
responsibility of States that are defending themselves
against terrorism and protecting their territorial integrity and
sovereignty. The Council would be ill advised to do it this
time. Were the Council to recognize the right of some
States to fight terrorism and deny that right to others in
one way or another, or were it even to threaten punitive
measures, it would then formally legalize the practice of
double standards. It would have catastrophic consequences
for the struggle against terrorism in general, erode trust in
the Security Council and the entire United Nations system
and allow international relations to be governed by the
right of might instead of by law and principle.
The positions taken by the Contact Group in London
on 9 March 1998 and in Bonn on 25 March 1998 are
tantamount to the pursuit of a policy of force and so-
called gunboat diplomacy. Under the pressure of certain
Powers, the Contact Group, by its policy, places itself
above every Government and every principle. Those
Powers dictate solutions to internal questions and decide
who can and who cannot defend himself against terrorism
and separatism. They even determine who must cooperate
in the destruction of the integrity of the territory of one‚Äôs
own State. Sanctions are threatened, as well as military
intervention, and the normal economic development and
lives of millions of people are hampered ‚Äî and all in the
name of democracy and human rights. The Contact
Group, by its policy, places itself over and above the
Charter of the United Nations in an attempt to transform
the Security Council, before the eyes of the world, into a
body that merely executes decisions taken at some other
place, and with a motivation that is different from the
goals and objectives of the Charter.
It is with regret and deep concern that we note that,
by their activities, representatives of some permanent
members of the Security Council encourage the
separatism of the leaders of the Albanian national
minority in Kosovo and Metohija. They are currently
causing enormous damage to Serbia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. However, that policy will bring
no good to their own countries either, or to Europe or the
world. On the contrary, it is counterproductive and
dangerous for the international legal system and for all
the countries and peoples of the world at the threshold of
the third millennium.
It is stated in the statements of the Contact Group
and the resolution of the Security Council that the
situation in Kosovo and Metohija threatens international
peace and security in the region. This position is not
based on facts, nor on law. It is designed to justify
support for separatism and flagrant interference in the
internal affairs of a sovereign country, a Member State of
the United Nations. The arbitrary pressure on Serbia and
16
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is aimed at imposing a
solution that is a direct threat to the territorial integrity of
Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A local
anti-terrorist police action can never be qualified as a threat
to international peace and security. The situation in Kosovo
and Metohija is stable and does not threaten, nor can it
threaten, in any way the peace and security of neighbouring
countries or the region. There are no armed conflicts in
Kosovo and Metohija.
It is therefore very clear that there is no basis for
invoking Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter or for
taking any measure by invoking any other principle or
document.
The Contact Group is not authorized to create, by its
statements, obligations, legal or factual, for the Security
Council to establish the calendar of its meetings and
decisions or to determine the content of those decisions.
That would deal a serious blow to the dignity of the
Security Council.
The real threat to regional peace and security is the
overt or covert support that, under the influence of
Albanian lobbies in some countries, certain circles ‚Äî
permanent members of the Security Council ‚Äî render to
secessionism and to the leaders of the political parties of
the Albanian minority in Kosovo and Metohija. This is
contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United
Nations and the Final Act of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and contrary to the
interests of peace and security in Southeast Europe. It
causes great damage to the lasting interests of the members
of the Albanian national minority themselves in Serbia and
Yugoslavia, as well as in other countries of the region.
We recall that the Government of the Republic of
Serbia has addressed a number of public and direct calls to
the representatives of the political parties of the Albanian
national minority for an unconditional, direct and genuine
political dialogue. The representatives of all other minorities
that have lived in Kosovo and Metohija for centuries ‚Äî the
Muslims, Romanies, Turks, Croats and others ‚Äî requested
to take part in the dialogue themselves, since questions
relative to their rights as well have been raised. Those
requests are legitimate and have been accepted. The
members of those minorities have publicly condemned
terrorism; their lasting desire is to live in Serbia ‚Äî a State
of their own ‚Äî and to solve all questions relating to the
realization of their rights within Serbia and by political
means. A considerable number of influential Albanians in
Kosovo and Metohija have also distanced themselves from
separatism, condemned terrorism and displayed interest in
seeking solutions through dialogue to all outstanding
questions, as well as better living conditions in Serbia,
alongside all other citizens.
The leaders of some political parties of the Albanian
national minority are the only ones who have not heeded
the invitation of the Government of the Republic of
Serbia to unconditional dialogue. They continue to turn a
deaf ear to the appeals of the international community to
condemn terrorism publicly and to give up the idea of
independence.
Consequently, who is responsible for separatism and
terrorism in Kosovo and Metohija or for the
procrastination and delay of the dialogue? Serbia, which,
by its Constitution and laws, guarantees all rights to the
members of all national minorities under the highest
European standards ‚Äî rights that are exercised by the
members of 26 out of the total of 27 national minorities
in its territory? Or is it the leaders of separatism who ‚Äî
by pressure, blackmail and even by recourse to
terrorism ‚Äî force the boycott of those rights?
Since the Republic of Serbia is deeply convinced
that procrastination and the delay of the beginning of a
direct political dialogue are unjustified and harmful and
that they block the genuine political process in Kosovo
and Metohija, the President of the Republic of Serbia,
Milan Milutinovic¬¥, issued on 18 March 1998 the
declaration on the political process in Kosovo and
Metohija, calling on the leaders of the political parties of
the Albanian national minority in Kosovo and Metohija to
embark upon a political dialogue without delay or
conditions. The President of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic¬¥, fully supported the
declaration and designated his personal envoy to conduct
dialogue with the representatives of the Albanian and
other national minorities in Kosovo and Metohija.
By its declaration of 31 March 1998, the new
Government of the Republic of Serbia further reaffirmed
the initiative and its openness to a genuine and
unconditional dialogue and renewed its invitation to the
leaders of the Albanian political parties to dialogue, for it
is clear that no other solution is available.
The agreement on the implementation of the
Education Agreement is an important positive
accomplishment. Besides, the Institute of Albanology in
Pri≈°tina was officially opened yesterday by the
representatives of the Government of the Republic of
17
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
Serbia and made available to its Albanian users. This is the
only institution of its kind for the Albanian minority in
South-East Europe, and it is unique in Europe in the
context of the exercise of minority rights by any national
minority.
Upholding its principled position that it is necessary to
regularize Yugoslavia's full-fledged membership in the
OSCE, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has expressed
its readiness to receive, on a contractual basis, an OSCE
mission of longer duration. We would like to trust, in the
objectivity of this mission, for we believe that it could
contribute to spreading the truth about the situation in
Kosovo and Metohija. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
is also ready to receive a personal representative of the
OSCE Chairman-in-Office and of the European Community
to conduct talks with the representatives of the Government
on questions of cooperation and normalization of relations.
Considering that the limited action in the area of
Drenica has ended and that the situation is stable, the
special anti-terrorist unit, with its equipment and means, has
been withdrawn to its permanent base outside the region.
This has been affirmed also in the declaration of the new
Government of the Republic of Serbia of 31 March 1998.
The official judicial authorities have opened an inquiry
aimed at establishing facts relative to the allegations that
the police exceeded their authority during the anti-terrorist
actions.
Serbia and the Government of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia are quite open to cooperation with the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which
we consider the key humanitarian organization. This was
borne out also by the letter of 24 March 1998 to the ICRC
President from the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs,
Zivadin Jovanovic¬¥. Representatives of the ICRC and other
humanitarian organizations operate freely in Kosovo and
Metohija, which was confirmed also by the ICRC
representative in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 15
March 1998 the Government of the Republic of Serbia also
extended an invitation to Cornelio Sommaruga, ICRC
President, to send an ad hoc group of expert pathologists,
composed of representatives of various countries, to Kosovo
and Metohija to establish facts relative, in particular, to the
allegations that civilians have been killed in the
aforementioned anti-terrorist actions. Separate invitations
have also been extended to a number of countries to send
their independent experts, who, alongside the Yugoslav
pathologists and judicial authorities, would carry out that
task.
Official Yugoslav representatives have reaffirmed
their readiness to cooperate with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, whose office in
Belgrade carries out its activities on the entire territory of
Yugoslavia undisturbed.
Terrorist actions and secessionist goals cannot be
equated with the legitimate struggle against terrorism: the
defence of a State, its sovereignty, its integrity and the
safety of its citizens.
Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have
nothing to hide in Kosovo and Metohija. Foreign
diplomats and other representatives, and hundreds of
foreign journalists and parliamentarians visit and travel up
and down Yugoslavia and Serbia every day. Besides, the
International Committee of the Red Cross and other
international humanitarian organizations and governmental
and non-governmental organizations operate in Kosovo
and Metohija undisturbed. These are facts that cannot be
denied.
Kosovo and Metohija is an integral part of Serbia,
and every problem arising in that Serbian province is an
internal matter. Serbia is firmly committed to an
unconditional dialogue with the members of the Albanian
minority and to the solution of all questions through
political means in accordance with European standards.
As a signatory of the Helsinki Final Act and as a
European country, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
accepts all standards of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and of the Council of Europe
relative to the rights of national minorities, and is open to
full and constructive cooperation. However, questions of
constitutional and State organization, relations between
various levels of government and relations between
government and self-rule belong to the internal
jurisdiction of States. Such questions are internal matters
for each sovereign State and hence for Serbia and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Such questions brook no
foreign intervention or internationalization. It is my firm
belief that this position is in full conformity with the
Charter of the United Nations.
The call of some countries for solutions to be sought
outside Serbia ‚Äî or, as they say, within the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia ‚Äî constitutes a violation of the
territorial integrity of Serbia, a State which has been in
existence for more than 13 centuries, much longer than
even the first ideas of ‚ÄúYugoslavness‚Äù. The United
Nations must not allow itself to be a confederate of those
18
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
who loath the idea of one integrated Serbia as a republic of
equal citizens. The Security Council should continue to
uphold the noble principle that all countries, big or small,
are equal. It should not harbour policies of force and double
standards.
The President: The next speaker is the representative
of Germany. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
Mr. Eitel (Germany): At the outset, Sir, let me
express my delegation's satisfaction and my personal
pleasure at having seen you preside over this month's
Security Council meetings ‚Äî and, especially, over today's
meeting, which marks an important step in the efforts to
bring peace to Kosovo. Let me add that my compliments go
also to your predecessor, our colleague from Gabon.
I want now to affirm that Germany fully supports and
subscribes to the statement that the representative of the
United Kingdom made on behalf of the European Union.
In the Kosovo region of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, tension has been building up over several
years. Repression of the Kosovar Albanian community and
serious violations of human rights contributed to this, along
with increasing doubts within that community about the
success of the Kosovar Albanian leadership's course of non-
violent opposition. Guerrilla attacks on police stations and
the excessive use of force by Yugoslav security forces,
resulting in at least 80 fatalities, were the latest steps in that
escalation. My country is deeply concerned about this
political state of affairs, as well as about the resulting
humanitarian situation.
More than many other States, Germany is affected by
this situation. Germany is the refuge of an estimated
300,000 ethnic Albanians, most of them from Kosovo, out
of the total of an estimated 1.3 million persons from the
former Yugoslavia currently living in Germany. When on
25 March, the Foreign Ministers of the Contact Group met
in Bonn to discuss the situation in Kosovo, some 40,000
Kosovar Albanians also met in Bonn ‚Äî for a peaceful
demonstration.
After the latest outbreak of violence, on 6 March,
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel sent a message to you,
Mr. President, calling for the Security Council to address
the situation in Kosovo. We thank you, Sir, for your prompt
response to that request. Along with the other Contact
Group members, we had been actively seeking the
preparation of the resolution just adopted by the Council.
The explosive situation in the Kosovo region constitutes
a clear threat to international peace and security. The
genesis of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which in
the beginning was considered by some to be an internal
matter, is still very much alive in our memories. The
outside world cannot simply stand by and watch a new,
potentially even more devastating conflict develop in the
region.
Alongside the Security Council, the Contact Group
has been actively involved in the ongoing international
peace efforts to avoid further bloodshed and bring about
a political solution. At its ministerial meeting in London
on 9 March, the Contact Group spelled out clearly what
the international community expects from both sides. In
particular, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was called
upon: to withdraw special police units and cease
excessive action by security forces affecting the civilian
population; to allow access by the International
Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian
organizations; and to commit itself publicly to begin a
process of dialogue with the leadership of the Kosovar
Albanians.
On 19 March, the Foreign Ministers of France and
of Germany, Hubert V√©drine and Klaus Kinkel, travelled
to Belgrade together and came home with a number of
commitments by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
At their meeting on 25 March in Bonn, the Foreign
Ministers of the Contact Group assessed the developments
and came to the conclusion that there had been progress
in some areas of concern, in particular an understanding
on the implementation of the Education Agreement. The
overall assessment, however, was that the actions taken
by the leadership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
fell short of the demands laid down at the London
meeting, and that the Contact Group therefore had to
maintain the measures taken against the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia.
In this context, and hand in hand with the United
Nations and the Contact Group, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the
European Union also have a crucial role to play. We fully
support the skilful efforts of Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek of Poland as Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE
as well as the role of mediator foreseen for the former
Prime Minister of Spain, Felipe Gonz√°lez. It is also worth
noting that the Office of the Prosecutor of the
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has
19
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
affirmed its jurisdiction regarding the violence in Kosovo
and begun gathering information on the latest events.
Today's resolution sends two very clear messages.
First, the international community will do its utmost to
avoid a resurgence of violence in the Balkans region; and
secondly, a political solution of the Kosovo problem is
more than overdue. We condemn violence and terrorism, no
matter which side is to blame.
Germany wants to see the Kosovo problem solved
peacefully, through negotiations. We therefore support the
call upon the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
leadership of the Kosovar Albanians, contained in the
resolution, to enter without preconditions into a meaningful
dialogue, including on political status issues. Without
prejudging what the result may be, the resolution supports
an enhanced status for Kosovo within the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, with a substantially greater degree of
autonomy and meaningful self-administration. Such a
solution would by no means impair the sovereignty or the
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The arms embargo foreseen in the resolution is an
effort to prevent an arms buildup of the opposing sides. It
is, however, also a political measure which illustrates that
resorting to violence and rejecting meaningful dialogue will
bring those responsible, and the countrymen they bear
responsibility for, farther away from the beneficial
normalization of their relations with the outside world. The
fate of their countrymen and of their own international
position is at stake.
Germany therefore supports the resolution adopted by
the Council today.
The President: I thank the representative of Germany
for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Italy. I invite
him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
Mr. Terzi de Sant'Agata (Italy): I would like to
express the warmest congratulations of my delegation to
you, Sir, and to your country for having so successfully
presided over the intense work of the Council this month.
I would like to extend the same congratulations to your
predecessor, the Ambassador of Gabon.
I wish first of all to associate myself with the
statement made by the charg√© d'affaires of the United
Kingdom on behalf of the European Union. Italy fully
supports the European Union's position on the situation in
Kosovo and the common position adopted in Brussels on
19 March.
In early March, the Kosovo crisis broke out, giving
rise to acts of violence that we firmly condemn. The
international community has stepped up initiatives to
prevent this conflict from plunging the region into yet
another vicious cycle of ethnic bloodshed, which would
destroy the delicate balance that had brought some
measure of stability after years of civil war. Our concern
is that the Kosovo question will have repercussions on the
entire Balkans region, where the international community
has been engaged in a monumental effort to halt the
process of disintegration and foster the healing and
rehabilitation of the State institutions.
Italy is playing an active role in these efforts and has
made a substantial contribution through its leadership of
the multinational force in Albania last year, its support of
economic development cooperation in that country and in
the area, and its sizable participation in the peacekeeping
mission in Bosnia. Italy also takes active part in and will
continue to contribute to the decision-making process in
the Contact Group, the European Union, and here at the
United Nations.
In London, on 9 March, the Contact Group identified
the objectives that needed to be pursued to defuse the
crisis and the instruments required to achieve them. In
Bonn, on 25 March, it was acknowledged that some
progress had been made, but that some requests had not
been fulfilled.
A positive step was taken in Pri≈°tina on 23 March,
when the protocol for the application of the Education
Agreement was signed. In our opinion, the protocol
represents a clear confidence-building measure; it was
made possible by the decisive contribution of Monsignor
Vicenzo Paglia of the Comunit√° di' Sant'Egidio, to whom
Italy and other countries in the Contact Group afforded
the broadest support. For its part, Italy hopes that these
understandings can facilitate a solution that grants an
enhanced status of autonomy and respect to the cultural
identity of the Kosovar people, as they rightly expect.
In the meantime, we have kept up an intense
dialogue with the Belgrade authorities and the Kosovar
Albanian leadership in Pri≈°tina. We are convinced that the
international community must insist that Belgrade
implement all our requests. We must be equally steadfast
20
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
in urging the Pri≈°tina authorities to accept the offer to start
a political dialogue without setting conditions. A greater
degree of autonomy on the basis of the territorial integrity
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia can be negotiated. At
the same time, the Kosovar Albanians must bear in mind
that the road to independence would only create new
conflicts and that any attempts at compromise would be
voided by a radical position.
Italy hopes that the start of a concrete, open-minded
dialogue between Belgrade and Pri≈°tina will be inserted in
a process that, should it bear positive fruit, will improve the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's prospects for full
participation in the international organizations. In this
perspective, Italy believes that talks should be pursued with
both parties and that we must urge Belgrade to fulfil the
requests made, including the unconditional start of political
dialogue, the complete withdrawal of the special police
forces, consent to a joint mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the
European Union, and access to Kosovo for humanitarian
organizations.
This is why today's resolution imposes an arms
embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: to prevent
the aggravation of an already unstable situation and
weapons from prevailing over dialogue. I would like
underline that this resolution contains a firm condemnation
not only of all forms of violence, but also of terrorism,
which must be rejected without reservation. This is why we
take note of Dr. Rugova's commitment to non-violence and
hope that it will be explicitly shared by all the political
forces in Kosovo.
Today's decision completes the package of measures
adopted in London on 9 March. The Contact Group will
meet again in late April to verify progress in the political
dialogue and in the attitude of the parties. Until then, my
country will continue to do its utmost in Belgrade and
Pri≈°tina to foster a peaceful solution to the question, in the
spirit of the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki principles,
and the OSCE standards.
The President: I thank the representative of Italy for
the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker on my list is the representative of
Turkey. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and
to make his statement.
Mr. Tan√ß (Turkey): First of all, Sir, I should like to
express our appreciation at seeing you preside over the
proceedings of the Council during this month, and my
delegation would like also to thank the Permanent
Representative of Gabon for presiding over the Council's
work last month.
Turkey is gravely concerned at the situation in
Kosovo and the wider implications it may have for peace,
security and stability in the region and beyond. Unless
appropriate measures are taken in time, the conflict in
Kosovo will intensify and may drag the Balkans into
serious turmoil. The tragic consequences of the
international community's not having shown a sufficient
and timely response to such a crisis were witnessed in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The dangers inherent in the situation in Kosovo have
been visible since at least 1989, when the acquired rights
of autonomy and self-administration of the people of
Kosovo were suddenly abrogated. Moreover, the
economic hardships and deprivation faced by the people
of Kosovo following the disintegration of the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia put unbearable strain on
their endurance. The restrictions on the right of education
also added fuel to the feeling of deep resentment, as, over
the years, children have been deprived of adequate
education.
Consequently, as a reaction, the desire for
independence in Kosovo has grown. And the new Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), instead
of reinstating the rights of the people of Kosovo, has
resorted to repression and agitation. The reaction of the
Kosovar Albanians to all this has reached the point of
explosion.
The rights taken away from the people of Kosovo
should be restored to them urgently. Unless an agreed
solution is found, the explosion in Kosovo may shake all
the neighbouring countries, including all the Balkan
countries, and lead to a wider international crisis.
The democratic and pluralistic nature of Kosovo is
of the utmost importance. The presence of a Turkish
community in Kosovo, the large number of Turkish
citizens of Balkan origin and Turkey's geographic location
will further explain our close attention to this crisis.
Turkey is keenly interested in the finding of a satisfactory
solution to the plight of the people of Kosovo and in the
protection of their acquired and human rights.
In this context, since tensions escalated in the
Kosovo region and violence broke out on 28 February,
21
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
resulting in loss of life, Turkey has been in contact with
many concerned parties and with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia authorities with a view to seeing an end to the
violence and the commencement of a political process. The
Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Belgrade on 7
and 8 March. We participated in the adoption of the
declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of countries
of South-Eastern Europe, which set out the elements of a
political process. We support the efforts of the Contact
Group, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC).
My Government has formulated the following
proposals towards finding a concrete solution to the Kosovo
problem.
A solution to the dispute must be found through
comprehensive dialogue between the parties and within the
framework of the territorial integrity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Any
resort to acts of terrorism or violence must be avoided.
It should be possible for a third party, which will be
decided on by the two sides, to assume a function that
would facilitate reaching a settlement.
The dialogue aimed at reinstating all the rights of all
the ethnic minorities in Kosovo should begin immediately.
These minorities, including the Turkish community, should
be represented in the talks concerning the future of Kosovo.
The solution to be found should guarantee the rights of all
the ethnic minority groups, together with the Albanian
majority.
Effective measures against the possibility of violence
and repression in Kosovo should be taken with the
participation of the international community, which should
also contribute to meeting the urgent economic and
humanitarian needs of the people of Kosovo and displaced
persons.
The gravity of the situation is of such dimensions as
to warrant the urgent action taken by the Security Council.
We hope that the determined efforts of the international
community will not only help resolve this problem through
peaceful means but also set a lasting precedent both for the
region and beyond.
The President: I thank the representative of Turkey
for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker on my list is the representative of
Pakistan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
Mr. Babar (Pakistan): It is a pleasure, Sir, to see
you presiding over the meeting of the Security Council
today. We note with satisfaction that the Council has
taken a number of important decisions under your
presidency during the current month.
The situation in Kosovo is a matter of great concern
for the international community. The reign of terror let
loose by the Serbian forces in Kosovo has resulted in the
killing of a large number of civilians, including women,
children and the elderly. We are deeply concerned that the
Serbian forces have yet again resorted to ‚Äúethnic
cleansing‚Äù, which should be deplored by the international
community in the strongest possible terms.
The Government of Pakistan strongly condemns the
genocide of the ethnic Albanians by the Serbian forces in
Kosovo. Pakistan also strongly condemns terrorism in all
its forms and manifestations, whether perpetrated against
the people of Kashmir, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Palestine
or Kosovo.
The Serbian forces should immediately cease their
coercive action against the people of Kosovo and take
steps to protect and promote internationally accepted
norms of human rights. We must not allow the
perpetrators of heinous crimes against humanity to go
unpunished.
The Government of Pakistan supports the measures
proposed by the Security Council in the resolution it has
adopted today. The international community must not
allow a repetition of genocide and ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù by
alien oppressors anywhere in the world.
The President: I thank the representative of
Pakistan for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker on my list is the representative of
Albania. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
Mr. Nesho (Albania): First of all I would like to
commend Ambassador Abdoulie Momodou Sallah of
Gambia for his excellent job conducting the work of the
Security Council during this month.
22
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
The adoption of this resolution by the Security Council
attests to the immediate reaction of the international
community in order to reach a swift and peaceful solution,
thus avoiding a new tragedy which may have larger and
more frightening dimensions than the tragedy of Bosnia.
This action reaffirms the primary and important role of the
United Nations and its organs, which, working in close
cooperation through preventive diplomacy with the
democratic States, are striving to apply the new philosophy
of the end of this century: the new world order, the order
of democracy and freedom for citizens.
The Republic of Albania hails and supports every
initiative or action offered by the Contact Group, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) and other countries and international organizations
which have assumed the responsibility of offering their
invaluable contribution to bring an end to the crisis in
Kosovo and to its peaceful resolution. The Albanian
Government commends the statements of the Contact
Group in London and Bonn, and the Security Council's
statement to the press on the situation in Kosovo, and it
appreciates all the efforts of the members of the
Coordinating and Consultative Process of the Contact
Group in New York (CCP) and the Security Council in
searching for the most acceptable position for the parties
involved with the goal of assuring stability and peace in the
region.
We all hoped that the achievement of peace in Bosnia
and the success of the Dayton process, as well as the tragic
loss of the lives of hundreds of thousand of innocent
citizens in the former Yugoslavia, would be a great historic
lesson in the way of understanding the value of coexistence
among nations and States, of bringing an end to the
instincts of hate and domination, thus enabling people to
cooperate and integrate with each other. It is quite to the
contrary in Kosovo, where, the ethnic Albanians
constituting over 90 per cent of the population, the violence
and terror exercised by the Serbian authorities not only
suppress the rights and the freedom of the citizens, but
above all deny the Albanian people the right to life.
There is no historic medieval symbol to justify or
legitimize the criminal killings of the innocent Albanian
civilian population. The Albanian people are resilient,
thanks to their philosophy of survival, which is a
philosophy of freedom and democracy, based on the right
to education and self-government and on their resolve to
gain their legitimate rights in a peaceful way, as was
testified once more in the last parliamentary elections of 22
March 1998 in Kosovo, which reconfirmed the peaceful
approach of Dr. Rugova.
The Government of the Republic of Albania has
long been elaborating the concept of cooperation among
the Balkan States, of mutual understanding among nations
as a precondition for the integration of the Balkans into
democratic European civilization. The summit of Crete
held last year was an expression of our good will to this
end. The Albanian Government has repeatedly appealed
to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) to respect the national identity of the
Albanian population not only in accordance with the
standards of the former Yugoslavia, but also with the
standards of the nations and citizens of the free world,
and to legalize political, administrative, cultural, media
and religious institutions in Kosovo.
The Republic of Albania believes that there will be
no peace in the region as long as there no political and
economic balance between the forces, the States and the
nations involved. My Government favours a peaceful
resolution of the conflict, does not support the use of
violence and is firm in demanding a harsh condemnation
of Serbia. It calls for the immediate withdrawal of the
Serbian military, paramilitary and police forces and for
serious talks, declaring that borders will not change and
that the Kosovo problem must be considered as were
those of other Yugoslav republics, always by applying the
European model.
The adoption of this resolution by the Security
Council along with all initiatives and actions of various
countries and international organizations will guarantee
the establishment of the necessary balance in the region.
Given the dimensions of the Kosovo crisis and the danger
of it spilling over to the south of the Balkan Peninsula,
which might have unforeseeable dimensions, the crisis
goes far beyond the limits of ‚Äúsome implications for the
regional security‚Äù. We do believe that the great
responsibility of the Member States of the Security
Council to preserve peace and security in the area, in
order to avoid a new tragedy, will guide them to take the
necessary decisions without delay.
The logic of normal diplomatic action and the logic
of historical precedent, as well as the observance of
traditional balances, cannot be successful in the face of a
new impending tragedy.
Allow me to express on this occasion my country's
gratitude for the swift action and long-term approach of
23
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
the United States of America, the European Union and the
members of the Contact Group towards the resolution of
the crisis. We believe that the spirit of responsibility and
understanding that accompany the adoption of this Security
Council resolution will guide its member States in their
future actions on this very important issue.
The President: I thank the representative of Albania
for his kind words addressed to me.
The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Poland. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. Wyzner (Poland): Speaking on the last day of
your term as President of the Security Council, Sir, I would
like to convey our appreciation for the leadership you have
provided to the Council during the month of March. May
I also congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Dangue
R√©waka of Gabon, on his successful conduct of the
Council's work in the month of February.
I should also like to associate myself unequivocally
with statement made on behalf of the European Union by
Mr. Richmond.
Like other members of the international community,
Poland is seriously concerned at the situation in Kosovo.
Without being addressed in an adequate way, contained and
eventually resolved, the crisis is bound to adversely affect
the still fragile peace and security in this part of Europe.
On 10 March 1998, Professor Bronislaw Geremek, the
Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Chairman-in-
Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), presented ‚ÄúThe Action Plan for Kosovo‚Äù.
It was later endorsed by the Permanent Council of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in its
Decision 218 of 11 March 1998, which contains a number
of concrete measures that, if implemented by the parties
concerned, could help in decreasing existing tensions and
creating the climate necessary for starting meaningful
dialogue between the authorities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Albanian community in Kosovo.
During the last 10 days the Head of the OSCE,
together with other members of that Organization‚Äôs Troika
visited Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The
main conclusion drawn from the extensive talks with
leaders of the countries bordering the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia is that they perceive the situation in Kosovo as
a real threat to the stability of the whole area and,
consequently, that they expect the international
community to play a role in resolving the crisis. As for
the talks in Belgrade, it is clear that the decisive steps
remain to be taken by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and the Serbian authorities in order to make the peaceful
resolution of the Kosovo dilemma a reality.
My country fully shares the assessment of the
situation in Kosovo formulated at the London and Bonn
meetings of the Contact Group, held on 9 and 25 March
1998 respectively, and supports the ensuing conclusions.
I refer in particular to paragraph 6 of the Bonn statement,
according to which Belgrade has not yet fully complied
with the requirements of the Contact Group. May I
emphasize at this point that consent for the mission of
Mr. Felipe Gonz√°lez, as Personal Representative of the
OSCE Chairman-in-Office and European Union Special
Representative, is long overdue. We also deem it
important to add our voice to those calling for the urgent
start of the process of unconditional dialogue with the
leadership of the Kosovar Albanian community, involving
the federal Yugoslav and Serbian republican levels of
government. It is imperative that both sides promptly
convene talks in order to agree on a framework for a
substantive negotiating process, with the participation of
an outside representative or representatives.
We support the Kosovar Albanians‚Äô right to enjoy a
substantially greater degree of autonomy, including
meaningful self-administration within the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. Any attempt to suppress this
right, especially by using force, deserves condemnation.
At the same time, my country unequivocally opposes
all terrorist activities. The only way to resolve the
situation in Kosovo is through peaceful dialogue and
negotiation. Violence leads nowhere: this is true with
regard to extremist elements among the Kosovar
Albanians, and it is also true with regard to the excessive
and indiscriminate use of force by the police in Kosovo.
The threat of violence still present in Kosovo has to
be removed. We understand that this is one of the main
objectives of the resolution that was adopted a short while
ago by the Council. By its adoption, the Security Council
sent an appropriately strong signal that the international
community is determined not to allow further
deterioration of the situation in Kosovo and that it expects
the parties concerned to implement the steps leading to a
genuine, lasting and peaceful solution to the crisis, as
24
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
stipulated in the relevant documents of the OSCE and the
Contact Group.
The President: I thank the representative of Poland
for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker on my list is the representative of
Hungary. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
Mr. Erd√∂s (Hungary) (interpretation from French):
First allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on the work you
have accomplished this month as President of the Security
Council.
Hungary associates itself with the statement made
earlier by the Presidency of the European Union with
regard to the problem of Kosovo. Like the entire
international community, it is following with particular
attention the serious events that are taking place in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As a neighbouring country,
Hungary feels increasingly anxious about the evolving
situation in Kosovo. Tension in this region of Yugoslavia
is a new and disturbing source of destabilization, all the
more dramatic given that nearby we are witnessing the very
welcome economic and political consolidation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, while in Croatia the process of the
peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia is progressing
successfully.
It is important to underline that the reasons for the
crisis in Kosovo are not new and that they should have
been addressed long ago. The authorities in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia should have taken necessary
measures much earlier to prevent the current explosion of
violence. Repeated omissions in this area have led to a
situation that threatens to ignite the whole region, which is
already very volatile.
Hungary considers Kosovo an integral part of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It feels that it is only on
the basis of this principle that the future of the region can
be settled. On the other hand, it is also important to find a
lasting solution to the question of the status of Kosovo and
the problems relating to the enjoyment of human rights by
the Albanian community, which has been living there for
centuries. We believe that it is precisely the lack of
appropriate attention over the years to the rights of
minorities and to their legitimate claims that has led to the
present situation. Having said that, we condemn recourse to
violence and terrorism, whoever the perpetrators. Such
actions can hardly bring about calm or lead to a genuine
solution.
The modalities for arrangements relating to the status
of Kosovo will certainly depend on the outcome of a
substantive dialogue, which we hope will begin without
delay, between the authorities in Belgrade and the
representatives of the Kosovar Albanians, with external
participation. If it is to be acceptable to the parties, this
outcome will have to be in conformity with the standards
set by various relevant international instruments. In the
meantime, patient but methodical work to introduce the
greatest possible number of confidence measures, in order
to create a climate conducive to such a dialogue, must
continue relentlessly. It is reason on all sides, rather than
blind impulse, that must prevail.
Hungary cannot accept that the problem of Kosovo
should be dealt with as a strictly internal matter. This
argument would not even deserve mention here if recent
conflicts in this part of Europe had not reached such
horrifying proportions. Given the tragedy and bloodshed
that has swept over so many people, with 200,000 killed
and 2 million exiled, I do not believe that I need to
elaborate. Our essential task, here at the United Nations
and in other international multilateral forums, consists
precisely in preventing a deterioration of events in
Kosovo such as took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
To that end, the Government of Yugoslavia must
admit the futility of arguing against the international
community's offers of assistance. Belgrade must look
forward rather than backward; it must base its policy not
on the events of yesterday, not on old historical
animosities that all of us ‚Äî all of us ‚Äî in Europe,
including in Central and Eastern Europe, have
experienced, but on a vision of tomorrow, on the
interdependence and coexistence of communities of
differing ethnic and religious origins. It is important that
the Yugoslav authorities should sit at the negotiating table
with representatives of the Kosovar Albanian community
to resolve, peacefully and politically, the problems that
face them.
It is indispensable that they should permit the return
to Yugoslavia of long-term missions of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and that they
should recognize not only in words but in deeds the
importance of full respect for the rights of minorities and
of their participation in public life. This would go a long
way towards halting the wave of violence and terrorism
that is spreading over Kosovo. To do this, the
25
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
Government of Yugoslavia will have to accept the logic of
granting to non-Serb ethnic communities in Yugoslavia
rights similar to those that it demands for Serb populations
living outside its territory.
To overcome the crisis, one must avoid the pitfalls of
anti-Albanian ‚Äî and anti-Serb ‚Äî nationalist passions,
which only poison the situation in Kosovo. Rather than
offering vague promises and so-called concessions on
matters of secondary importance, there must be a focus on
the real issues, on matters that are of primary importance,
without any delay or procrastination. In that context, we
welcome the progress that has recently been made. Only in
this way can Yugoslavia improve its international position.
As a country directly affected by the situation on our
borders, and having maintained fruitful, excellent relations
with our neighbour to the south, Hungary ventures to hope
that the day will soon come when we can welcome to
international forums a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that
is at peace with itself and with the various ethnic and
religious communities living on its territory.
The resolution that the Security Council has just
adopted will help begin the process needed to identify the
elements of a long-term political solution for Kosovo.
The President: I thank the representative of Hungary
for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Croatia. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
Mr. ≈†imonovic¬¥ (Croatia): The Republic of Croatia
shares the concerns of the international community on the
situation in Kosovo and the impending threat to
international peace and security which it constitutes.
Croatia, as a neighbour of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, is vitally interested in a speedy resolution of
the crisis.
Croatia believes that all political issues in Kosovo,
including its future status, must be resolved between the
Belgrade authorities and Kosovar Albanians through a
genuinely democratic political process. The dialogue has to
take into account both the opinions of the Arbitration
Commission of the International Conference on Yugoslavia
‚Äî The Badinter Commission ‚Äî on the inviolability of the
borders of new States established following the dissolution
of the former Yugoslavia and the tradition of territorial
autonomy in Kosovo. The disrespect that the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia showed for the opinions of the
Badinter Commission regarding the territorial integrity of
neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is now,
regarding Kosovo, returning like a boomerang.
Croatia welcomes ‚Äî and emphasizes the importance
of ‚Äî the readiness of the international community to help
facilitate this process, as demonstrated by the resolution
that the Security Council has just adopted. My delegation
believes that the willingness of the international
community to play an active role in alleviating the tension
is vital for the achievement of a political solution. Croatia
supports all the efforts undertaken by the international
community in this regard, particularly the endeavours
made by the Contact Group and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) aimed at
halting the escalation of the conflict.
Croatia joins others in condemning the violation of
human rights in Kosovo and denounces all acts and forms
of terrorism, regardless of whether they are committed by
a State, a group or an individual, bearing in mind that
State terrorism represents the most dangerous form of
terrorism because of the resources available to States.
It is very clear that police repression is an
unacceptable method for resolving political issues in
Kosovo. Croatia expressed its disagreement with such
repressive methods used by Serbian authorities even
during the time of the former Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, when the Socialist Republic of Croatia
withdrew its police forces from the federal units deployed
in Kosovo. Today, as an independent and sovereign State,
Croatia adds its voice to the efforts of the international
community in seeking a peaceful resolution of the
conflict.
Croatia is particularly concerned by the possible
humanitarian catastrophe which could be caused by the
present crisis. The international community cannot allow
the same pattern of humanitarian disasters experienced in
Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to be repeated in
Kosovo. On this issue Croatia speaks from the experience
of a country which has during the past six years taken
care of more than 800,000 refugees and displaced
persons.
In this context, my delegation welcomes the fact that
the resolution calls on the authorities of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to allow international
humanitarian organizations full access to Kosovo in order
to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and to alleviate the
26
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
suffering of the civilian population. Croatia holds this to be
a humanitarian imperative.
Croatia acknowledges the importance of normalizing
relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
the rest of the international community. However, I should
like to stress that the participation of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia in international institutions is conditional
upon its application for membership and the fulfilment of
all criteria for acceptance into those institutions, as is the
case with every new applicant. Consequently, it is the
understanding of my delegation that this is the only context
within which paragraph 18 of the resolution can be
interpreted. The issue of succession to the former
Yugoslavia cannot be linked to the Kosovo crisis, because
it is a matter which involves all the successor States to the
former Yugoslavia and must be resolved on the basis of the
opinions of the Badinter Commission and international law.
The President: The next speaker is the representative
of Greece. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
Mr. Zacharakis (Greece): Let me first of all express
my appreciation for the work accomplished during your
month‚Äôs term in your high office. May I also congratulate
on this occasion your predecessor, the Permanent
Representative of Gabon.
My delegation subscribes to the statement delivered by
the representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the
European Union. I wish, however, to dwell further, very
briefly, upon certain points that are of special importance
to my country.
Greece, being a country of the area, takes a keen and
direct interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in
the Balkans and is therefore concerned over developments
in Kosovo as well as with the repercussions that the
possible deterioration of the situation there could have on
the stability of the region. In this context, Greece actively
participated in the meetings of the Ministers for Foreign
Affairs of the Countries of South-Eastern Europe in Sofia,
Bulgaria, and Bonn on 10 and 25 March, respectively, and
adheres to the joint statements adopted there, hoping that
the relevant decisions will lead to a swift settlement of the
issue in question.
My country firmly believes that a solution in Kosovo
must be sought only through peaceful means, namely
through dialogue between the Government in Belgrade and
the Kosovar Albanian leadership. Terrorism must be wholly
condemned and so must the excessive use of force insofar
as it stifles the free exercise of human rights.
On the other hand, Greece particularly insists upon
the need to safeguard the inviolability of existing
international borders, which is a fundamental and sine qua
non condition for peace and stability in the Balkans. In
this respect, Greece fully supports the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and categorically rejects any secessionist claims.
Finally, I wish to express my country‚Äôs support for
the resolution adopted by the Council today, which in our
view is balanced and should be implemented by all
parties concerned. But I would also like to point out that
any measures against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
should also take into account the stability of south-eastern
Europe and should not unduly harm States in the region,
which were particularly hit by the negative consequences
of the sanctions regime in the years 1992 through 1996.
The President: I thank the representative of Greece
for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
Mr. Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina):
Considering that it is 31 March and a rather late hour, I
would like to commend you, Sir, and your delegation for
the most comprehensive and appropriate manner in which
you have handled your presidency of the Security
Council, and in particular this debate.
The development of the peace process in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, both in spirit and substance, cannot help but
be impacted by the situation in Kosovo and our neighbour
in general, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
and Montenegro). Many formulate that the disintegration
of the former Yugoslavia started with the unilateral
repudiation of Kosovo‚Äôs autonomous status within the ex-
Yugoslavia and that the circle will be completed only
with the just and stable resolution of this situation. The
commitment of the Stabilization Force, the Office of the
High Representative and other international factors,
including the United Nations, have given the peace
process in Bosnia and Herzegovina a more stable
foundation, minimizing the risk of spill-over.
Nonetheless, the longer-term developments and
solutions for Kosovo can only have a substantial impact
27
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
on peace, stability and the development of democracy,
human rights and minority and national rights in the region
as a whole. In this context, my delegation believes that it is
imperative that the following fundamentals be incorporated
into any process designed to produce immediate and longer-
term solutions.
First, we welcome the Security Council‚Äôs role, as well
as that of other relevant international factors, in this
process, and emphasize the determinative importance of the
Security Council‚Äôs remaining seized of the matter. The
situation in Kosovo does have more than a passing impact
upon stability and peace in the region and international
security as a whole.
Second, in the same vein, the authority and active role
of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia is unquestionable and necessary in this
situation, despite the prolonged attempt of certain parties to
negate its jurisdiction. Bosnia and Herzegovina itself cannot
morally, politically or legally remain silent; as our former
colleague, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, so
appropriately put it, the Belgrade authorities will not be
allowed to do in Kosovo with what they can no longer get
away with in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ‚ÄúEthnic cleansing‚Äù
is intolerable for all, but those of us who have been victims
and overcome must be especially clear and add our voices
to the vigilant chorus of ‚ÄúNever Again‚Äù. We are not dealing
with ethnic madness, but with the political manipulation of
differences for crude, selfish power.
Third, Bosnia and Herzegovina stresses the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of all the States in the region,
without any prejudice to the eventual solution.
Fourth, at the same time we must emphasize that the
basis for solution, not only in Kosovo, but in Sandjak and
Vojvodina, lies with full respect for the democratic, human,
national and minority rights of all the citizens of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
Fifth, the role of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) in the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina has been frequently addressed before this
body. I do not need to remind the Council of the context of
those references. However, we must emphasize that the
health of our neighbour also reflects upon our own.
Sixth, let me draw the Council‚Äôs attention to
paragraphs 8, 9, 10 and 15 of the resolution before us.
Paragraph 15 in particular addresses the neighbours of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
Of course, that means us. Again, the role of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) reflected
a military relationship in its dealings with our country in
the past. We would like to stress the importance of the
arms-control arrangements negotiated under the authority
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, both within the region and in our country. Here,
the heightened vigilance of monitors can be helpful in
assuring that new abuses are not invented and old abuses
not repeated. Arms monitors ensuring compliance and
deterring cross-border transfers should receive our most
active support.
Seventh, we would like to underline the consistency
of the interpretation provided by the Permanent
Representative of Slovenia, Dr. Danilo T√ºrk, today with
that of the relevant Security Council and General
Assembly resolutions, as this relates to paragraph 18 of
the resolution before us.
Mr. President, thank you. I am confident that the
most responsible members of the United Nations, and in
particular the Security Council, have learned the painful
lessons of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the decisive
importance of the right response at the right time. We
soon will be able to judge as to whether today‚Äôs action by
the Security Council will do the job.
The President: I thank the representative of Bosnia
and Herzegovina for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Egypt. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
Mr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):
Today, the Security Council adopted a resolution
reimposing an international embargo on the export of
arms to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. There is no
doubt that this is a step, though it may be regarded as a
step backward with regard to the developments in the area
in general, yet it is a realistic reflection of the recent
deterioration of the situation in Kosovo.
Egypt considers the content of today's resolution as
a preventive message, which we hope that the concerned
parties will fully understand in a way that will prevent the
situation in the area from further deterioration and protect
the lives of the innocent Albanian civilians in the region.
This is especially so since the resolution adopted today
clearly condemns the excessive use of force by the
Serbian police against the civilians of Kosovo and clearly
28
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
defines the steps that the Government of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia should take in order to open the
way for the Security Council to review the sanctions
imposed on it today.
Our delegation has noted that the Security Council
candidly refers to the fact that this resolution has been
adopted under the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter
without a prior reference to a determination by the Security
Council that there exists a threat to international peace and
security as required by the provisions of Article 39 of the
Charter. Of course, it may be said that the Council is the
master of its own procedures, and this is correct with regard
to procedures. However, in principle, the constitutional
requirements in the Charter should in general be
scrupulously followed and respected. The delegation of
Egypt would like to record this observation with regard to
the future work of the Council.
At the same time, Egypt supports the content of the
resolution, namely its call upon the authorities in Belgrade
and the leadership of the Kosovar Albanian community
urgently to enter without preconditions into a serious
dialogue in order to reach a political settlement of the
situation in Kosovo. Such a settlement should take into
consideration the interests and the aspirations of the
Albanian community, which accounts for 90 per cent of the
population of the region, which has long had a special
status.
The situation in Kosovo represents a source of grave
concern to public opinion the world over. For this reason,
the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference adopted, at their latest meeting in Qatar in
March, a resolution in which they condemned the wide-
ranging acts of suppression, the discriminatory measures
and the human rights violations against the Albanian
inhabitants. They also called on the international
community to take the necessary steps to immediately end
these violations and to set up democratic institutions in
Kosovo. The adoption by the Council today of this
resolution is a step towards the achievement of what the
Foreign Ministers of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference called for two weeks ago.
In conclusion, my delegation hopes that the parties
concerned would exercise their authority responsibly
through the desired dialogue in order to reach a just
solution that would restore stability, security and peace to
the region.
The President: The next speaker on my list is the
representative of Ukraine. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. Yel'chenko (Ukraine): The violent incidents
which have recently shaken the Kosovo province, in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, have drawn the focused
attention of the international community. The horrible
remembrances of the not-so-distant events in Bosnia,
which resulted in thousands of innocent victims, the
practice of ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù and floods of refugees are
still vivid in our memory.
Although we believe that this is an internal affair of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the current situation
in Kosovo cannot but cause grave concern in Ukraine, as
a country which is adjacent to the Balkans. The fact that
these events are accompanied by violations of human
rights, acts of violence and casualties among the civilian
population causes us special concern.
The possibility of further confrontation and the real
threat of the escalation of the situation might lead to the
destabilization of the whole region, where, with the active
involvement of the international community, concrete
measures towards a normalization of the situation are
being undertaken.
Ukraine expresses its hope that in the nearest future
the situation in Kosovo will be settled through existing
multilateral mechanisms by means of peaceful dialogue,
tolerance and mutual understanding. Ukraine welcomes
recent diplomatic initiatives in this regard. For its part,
Ukraine stands ready to facilitate this process by all
possible means, in particular through the efforts of the
Contact Group and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
My delegation welcomes this timely meeting of the
Security Council, convened today to address the situation
in Kosovo. We hope that the adoption by the Security
Council of the resolution, and in particular the
introduction of the arms embargo, will foster the search
for peaceful solutions to this serious problem. At the
same time, Ukraine remains of the opinion that any
negative consequences which might affect third States as
a result of further restrictions imposed by the Security
Council against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
including Kosovo, should be properly considered by the
Council. It is our hope that soon the Security Council will
be ready to evaluate the real effect of this and other
29
Security Council 3868th meeting
Fifty-third year 31 March 1998
measures introduced by the resolution just adopted, as well
as the mechanism of its implementation.
In conclusion, Ukraine calls upon the authorities in
Belgrade and the leadership of the Kosovar Albanian
community to urgently enter without preconditions into a
meaningful dialogue on political status issues. I should like
to reconfirm the readiness of Ukraine to facilitate this
dialogue.
The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have just received a letter from the representative of
the Islamic Republic of Iran in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nejad
Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran) took a seat at
the Council table.
The President: I give the floor to the representative
of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Mr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran): Let
me first say, Sir, how happy we are that you are presiding
over the important deliberations of the Council today. We
are also thankful to you for convening this important
meeting.
The situation in Kosovo has caused considerable
international outrage because of the excessive use of force
by Serbian police against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
which has resulted in considerable loss of life and material
damage. This international outrage finds further grounds
and is duly increased because it is reminder of an unholy
and dark experience in Bosnia that has yet to be fully
resolved. The experience of Bosnia cannot and should not
be allowed to be repeated.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly raised
deep concern about the deteriorating situation in Kosovo
and condemned the suppression of and the use of force
against the Kosovar Albanians by Serbian Special Police,
which has led to the death of many civilians, including
women and children. The use of force and violence must be
rejected, and the authorities in Belgrade should take the
necessary steps so that the rights of the Kosovar Albanian
community are fully guaranteed. Furthermore, the
Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should
be persuaded that as far as the international community is
concerned, the solution to the problem can be found only
in a genuine and serious process of political negotiations
with the ethnic minority in Kosovo.
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the
solution to the problem in Kosovo lies in respecting the
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
on the one hand, and finding an agreed formula for the
political future of the Kosovar Albanian community
through political dialogue on the other.
The twenty-fifth ministerial meeting of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, held in Qatar
from 15 to 17 March 1998, expressed deep concern about
the violation of the political and human rights of the
Kosovar Albanian community, which constitutes about 90
per cent of the entire population in Kosovo. The meeting
condemned the use of force by Serbian police against the
Albanian minority and called for the withdrawal of
military forces from Kosovo.
The Islamic Republic of Iran supports the resolution
just adopted in the context of the international efforts to
curb further bloodshed in Kosovo and bring a political
solution to the conflict. We call upon both sides to
exercise restraint and engage in serious political
negotiations without preconditions on the political status
of Kosovo.
The President: I thank the representative of the
Islamic Republic of Iran for his kind words addressed to
me.
There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of
its consideration of the item on its agenda.
