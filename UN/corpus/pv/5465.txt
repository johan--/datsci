2 06-39055
The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2006/315)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus, document S/2006/315.
Members also have before them document
S/2006/393, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by China, France, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I met with the
representatives of the parties, who have confirmed to
me that they maintain their well-known positions vis-à-
vis the item on the Council’s agenda. On the basis of
those meetings, as President, with the consent of
members of the Council, I have drawn the conclusion
that the Council can proceed to take a decision on the
draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1687 (2006).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Vassilakis (Greece): My delegation has just
voted in favour of resolution 1687 (2006), which
extends the mandate of the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus for a further six-month
period, because it considers that the presence of the
Peacekeeping Force on the island continues to be
indispensable and imperative owing to the continuing
presence of approximately 40,000 Turkish troops on
the island and the security threat that that represents for
international peace and security.
There is no doubt that it is our common wish and
desire around this table that a just and permanent
solution be found to the problem of Cyprus on the
basis of Security Council resolutions so that the island
can be reunified and the two communities can enjoy a
common future, to the benefit of the maintenance of
peace and security both on the island and in the region.
The Secretary-General is about to dispatch the
Under-Secretary-General of Political Affairs to the
region in an attempt to strengthen the ongoing efforts
on the ground and to assess the political situation in
and around Cyprus and the prospects for a full
resumption of his good offices mission with the two
communities. We regret to note, however, that the text
adopted here today unfortunately does not convey a
sufficiently clear and strong message as to the basis,
the scope and the objectives of United Nations efforts
for a fair and lasting settlement of the problem of
Cyprus.
That is why Greece had insisted on the need to
clarify, in the sixth preambular paragraph — in which
the Council urges “progress towards the resumption of
negotiations for a comprehensive settlement” — that it
should be reaffirmed that those negotiations have to
take place between the two communities.
The President: There are no more speakers on
my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 3.25 p.m.
