Agenda
The situation in Somalia

S/PV.6853
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 2072 (2012).
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
Before concluding, I would like very much to thank
everyone for their goodwill in attending this very
special meeting. I am also grateful for the support we
received in the course of our presidency.
Our presidency has doubly been a victim of this
weekâ€™s events, which not only frustrated plans for the
end of our presidency but also affected our Permanent
Mission and my own residence, which are located in
an area where there is no electricity, water, Internet
service or anything else. That is the reason I am here in
battle fatigues today.
We are endeavouring to resolve the situation at our
Mission in order to regain a modicum of acceptable
operations. The one thing we have discovered is that a
world without Internet and electronic communications
does not work. I once again thank participants for their
attendance.
The meeting rose at 3.45 p.m.
The meeting was called to order at 3.40 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia

Council will now begin its consideration of the item on

Northern Ireland.

shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
