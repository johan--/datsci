The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2010/605)
Report of the Secretary-General on his mission
of good offices in Cyprus (S/2010/603)
The President: Members of the Council have
before them document S/2010/631, containing the text
of a draft resolution submitted by China, France, the
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.
Members also have before them documents
S/2010/605 and S/2010/603, respectively containing
the report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations operation in Cyprus and the report of the
Secretary-General on his mission of good offices in
Cyprus.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that the
presidency of the Council has met with the
representatives of the parties, who have confirmed that
they maintain their well-known positions vis-√†-vis the
item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. On the basis of those
meetings, with the consent of the members of the
Council, the presidency has drawn the conclusion that
the Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Uganda, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States
of America
Against:
Turkey
The President: There were 14 votes in favour
and one against. The draft resolution has been adopted
as resolution 1953 (2010).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Apakan (Turkey): I would like to briefly
share with the Council the reasons that compelled us to
vote against resolution 1953 (2010) today.
Since the adoption of resolution 186 (1964),
which set up the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP), all Council resolutions extending
the mandate of the Force are unfortunately still being
drafted as if there were only one side on the island.
There has not been a joint and constitutional
Government representing the whole of Cyprus since
1963. Treating the Greek Cypriot Government as the
Government of the whole island has been the main
obstacle in the way to finding a just, lasting and
comprehensive solution for over 46 years. For all those
years, Turkey has stressed that the consent and
cooperation of the two sides are backdrop principles
for the success of the peacekeeping operation.
Unfortunately, this erroneous practice has been
corrected neither in the previous resolutions nor in
today‚Äôs.
Although the resolution contains some elements
that encourage increased momentum in the
negotiations, it is short of reflecting the observations
contained in the report of the Secretary-General on his
mission of good offices (S/2010/603), in which he
underlines, inter alia, that the talks cannot be an open-
ended process and that a critical window of
opportunity is rapidly closing. We believe that the
resolution should have carried a stronger message to
that end.
That also applies to the support given to the
Special Adviser of the Secretary-General, Mr. Alexander
Downer. We believe that, by only welcoming his efforts,
the Security Council has not rendered its full support to
Mr. Downer at this very critical juncture in the
negotiating process.
We welcome the Secretary-General‚Äôs
determination to keep UNFICYP under close review
and to work on contingency planning. However, his
intention to conduct a broader assessment, which he
strongly emphasizes in both his reports, unfortunately
is not in any way reflected in the resolution. That is yet
S/PV.6445
310-69138
another important shortcoming as far as the resolution
is concerned.
I would like to reaffirm that the Turkish side has
implemented and will continue to implement the
provisions of the relevant resolutions. We believe that
achieving a mutually acceptable and comprehensive
settlement of the Cyprus problem within the
established United Nations parameters, which will
safeguard the fundamental and legitimate rights and
interests of two peoples on the island, is possible and
within reach.
The parameters of a solution in Cyprus are
known. There is a substantial body of work. Turkey
sincerely hopes that the two sides will show the
necessary political will to bring the negotiations to a
successful conclusion. In that respect, Turkey will
continue to fully support the Secretary-General in his
efforts and to cooperate with UNFICYP.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
