The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Finland, Germany and Italy in which they request to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Prica

the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them

prior consultations.
I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2006/810, containing a letter

of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I also wish to draw attention to document

from the Secretary-General, transmitting the seventh

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
