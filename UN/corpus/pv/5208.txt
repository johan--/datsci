regarding Liberia (S/2005/376)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Liberia, in which she requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Osode
(Liberia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General pursuant to Security
Council resolution 1579 (2004) regarding Liberia,
document S/2005/376. Members of the Council also
have before them document S/2005/401, which
contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the
course of the Council’s prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
