Threats to international peace and security caused
by terrorist acts
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2004/186, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
Before proceeding to the vote, I should like, on
behalf of the members of the Security Council, to
express our outrage at the terrorist attack that occurred
earlier today in Madrid, killing more than 190 people
and wounding over 1,000. The members of the Security
Council condemn this act of terrorism in the strongest
possible terms. They express their sympathy and
condolences to the victims and their families and to the
Government of Spain. On behalf of the members of the
Security Council, I should like to request the
representative of Spain to convey these sentiments to
the Government and the people of Spain.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/2004/186)
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,

The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1530 (2004).

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
