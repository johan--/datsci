The President: Pursuant to the decision taken at
the 6085th meeting of the Security Council, I invite the
representative of Timor-Leste to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
I should also like to inform the Council that I
have received letters from the representatives of
Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council’s agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries

have before them document S/2009/72, which contains
the report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
