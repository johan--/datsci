The meeting was called to order at 1.15 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Germany, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President,
Mr. Vukobratović (Bosnia and Herzegovina) took
a seat at the Council table; Mrs. Kania
(Germany) took the seat reserved for her at the
side of the Council Chamber.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/394, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the Russian Federation.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, China, Congo, France, Ghana,
Indonesia, Italy, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1764 (2007).
I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom voted in favour of the resolution today, but I
would like to give an explanation of our position. I
would like to place on record the United Kingdom’s
strong support for the role and responsibilities of the
High Representative, who is also the European Union’s
Special Representative. We welcome Mr. Miroslav
Lajčák to this role and we pledge our commitment to
cooperate with him as he discharges his responsibilities
under the Dayton Peace Agreement and subsequent
Peace Implementation Council (PIC) decisions and as
he leads the international community on the ground
and helps advance, in partnership with the authorities
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia’s Euro-Atlantic
integration.
As the resolution notes, it is the PIC Steering
Board that appointed the High Representative and that
decides on the mandate of his Office. While formal
agreement of the Security Council is not necessary, we
welcome the Council’s support for those decisions. We
hope that the leaders in Bosnia will see the adoption of
this resolution as an indication of the international
community’s firm backing for Mr. Lajčák and his
Office and for his future decisions, as it has backed all
previous High Representatives and their decisions.
We are disappointed at the nationalist sentiments
expressed by some Bosnian leaders in recent months.
These serve only to retard the reform process and
hinder the building of a multi-ethnic, democratic and
prosperous country on the verge of getting into Europe.
Our understanding is that nothing in this
resolution or those it recalls impacts on other Balkans
issues being considered by the Council.
Finally, I would like to say a word about the PIC
declaration of 19 June 2007. That declaration
confirmed that the Office of the High Representative
would remain in place and would continue to carry out
its mandate and that the aim is closure of the Office by
30 June 2008. The PIC will review the situation in
October 2007 and in February 2008. Those assessments
will naturally take into account the position of security
S/PV.5713
307-40581
and stability in the region. We hope that that security
and stability will be well and truly established by that
point and will be irreversible.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation welcomes the
Council’s adoption today of a draft resolution prepared
by my delegation on the Council’s agreement to the
appointment of Ambassador Miroslav Lajčák as the
new High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This decision is in keeping with the Dayton
Agreement, previous Council resolutions on Bosnia
and Herzegovina and previously reached agreements.
The very fact of the adoption of this resolution and its
content speaks for itself. We expect that the new High
Representative, Ambassador Lajčák, will continue with
the thoughtful and constructive approach taken by his
predecessor, Mr. Schwarz-Schilling, aimed at helping
the Bosnian parties to reach a compromise decision
through constructive dialogue. We believe that
Ambassador Lajčák will continue to work along those
lines, providing maximum assistance in the area of the
promotion of diplomatic mechanisms and local
initiatives and rejecting the practice of the unlimited
use of the Bonn powers.
I should like once again to express our gratitude
to Mr. Schwarz-Schilling for his work in the post of
High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.
