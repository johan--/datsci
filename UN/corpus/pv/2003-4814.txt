The meeting was called to order to order at 6 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Protection of United Nations personnel, associated
personnel and humanitarian personnel in conflict
zones
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/581, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, at this meeting, and I
give him the floor.
The Secretary-General: I wish to express my
strong support for the draft resolution before the
Council. I can think of no issue about which I feel
more strongly as Secretary-General ‚Äî and I believe
none should be more important to each member of the
Security Council ‚Äî than the safety of those brave men
and women who serve the Organization in the places
where it matters most, that is, in zones of conflict and
danger.
It is of course a fact of life that much of our work
is done in dangerous places, since that is where it is
most sorely needed. But that only strengthens the
obligation on all of us to take every step in our power
to protect those working under the blue flag and to
bring to justice those who attack or harm them.
Regrettably, in recent years we have not lived up to
that obligation. Attacks on humanitarian workers and
on United Nations personnel have increased
alarmingly. Again and again, peacekeepers or unarmed
civilians who have voluntarily gone in to help their
fellow men and women have been deliberately targeted
by armed factions seeking to make a political point or a
military gain or to intimidate the international
community.
Last week‚Äôs vicious attack on our headquarters in
Baghdad, with all its tragic consequences, has brought
that vital issue to the forefront of our priorities. It
shows us what we must expect if we allow the
impression to continue gaining ground that
international workers are a soft, cost-free target.
Impunity for those who commit such unpardonable
crimes cannot stand. There must be action.
Once again, I urge Member States in whose
territories attacks against United Nations personnel
have been committed to take practical and effective
steps to investigate and prosecute those responsible for
such crimes. I also urge those States that have not yet
done so to sign, ratify and accede to the Convention on
the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.
And, members of the Council, I urge you today to
adopt the timely draft resolution before you. I hope
very much that you will pass it unanimously and that
you will follow it up with action. In so doing, you will
send an unambiguous message to all those who
mistakenly believe that, in today‚Äôs turbulent world,
they can advance their cause by targeting the servants
of humanity. And if you succeed in strengthening the
security of United Nations staff, you will not only do
what, in all conscience, is your duty; you will also
increase the authority and effectiveness of the Council
by making clear that you are determined to protect
those whom you send into the field to implement your
decisions.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
Secretary-General for his important statement.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/2003/581)
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1502 (2003).

S/PV.4814
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Negroponte (United States of America): We
are pleased that the Security Council has adopted by
consensus this important resolution regarding the
protection of humanitarian personnel in conflict zones.
The importance of the work done by humanitarian
workers and the need to protect them has never been
more evident.
I wish to commend Ambassador Aguilar Zinser
and our other Mexican colleagues for their tireless
efforts to reach consensus. The efforts of the other
sponsors are also appreciated.
We live in a world where failed States, conflict,
poverty, hunger and privation are all too common.
Humanitarian personnel, United Nations personnel and
associated personnel play a vital and indispensable role
in easing suffering during times of conflict and
hardship and in helping countries that are emerging
from conflict to return to health. In Afghanistan, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi or Iraq,
humanitarian workers willingly and courageously serve
wherever need exists. As the Security Council, we
count on them to carry out this body‚Äôs mandates. They
cannot carry out those mandates if they cannot operate
in safety and it is right that we call for their protection
in this resolution.
This resolution moves beyond previous measures
in focusing the Security Council‚Äôs attention on both the
prevention of attacks on humanitarian, United Nations
and associated personnel and on the accountability of
those who commit such acts. I would like to make a
few observations about the consensus text.
We note that the fourth preambular paragraph
reaffirms the general rule that humanitarian and United
Nations personnel should observe and respect the laws
of the country in which they are operating. This
paragraph makes clear that this general rule must be
applied in accordance with international law, which
may provide for special rules that govern the
relationship between such personnel and the laws of
the host State.
We also note that operative paragraph 3 creates
no new international legal obligations, but rather
reaffirms the existing obligation of all parties involved
in an armed conflict to comply fully with the rules and
principles of international law applicable to them
during armed conflict.
Finally, we would note that operative paragraph 4
does not in itself create any new international legal
obligations, but rather urges concerned parties to
implement their existing international legal obligations
relating to access, the provision of facilities and the
promotion of safety, security and freedom of
movement. In this connection, we recall that both the
Hague Regulations and the Geneva Conventions
recognize that, during a period of armed conflict, the
extent to which a concerned party is able to allow such
access, make available such facilities or promote the
security of such personnel may be limited to those
steps that are practicable and consistent with the
security and operating environment.
We are all deeply saddened by the tragic events
that took place last week in Baghdad. Twenty-three
dedicated individuals who were engaged in helping the
people of Iraq lost their lives. This was an attack on the
entire civilized world and an immeasurable loss to the
international community. This resolution recognizes
and values the dedication and even heroism of those
humanitarian workers serving worldwide who, day
after day, knowingly risk their lives to reduce human
suffering and further the cause of peace. We welcome
its adoption.
Mr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):
I take the floor on behalf of the six countries that,
during the final phase of the negotiating process that
led to the unanimous adoption of this resolution,
moved the text forward and urged its consensus
adoption.
Bulgaria, Germany, France, the Russian
Federation, the Syrian Arab Republic and Mexico
participated in this effort, first, in the conviction that
the Security Council had clearly and unequivocally to
demonstrate its responsibility for the protection of
humanitarian workers. Secondly, its sponsors, in the
conviction that the resolution had to be adopted
unanimously, made it their task to send an unequivocal
message, as the Secretary-General pointed out, to those
who believe in impunity for acts against humanitarian
workers in conflict situations. The message to the
international community had to be equally clear and
unequivocal to the effect that the Security Council and
the United Nations as a whole are committed to
undertaking concrete actions leading to the creation of
4
S/PV.4814
a better framework of protection for humanitarian
workers in conflict situations.
We regret the fact that the resolution does not
explicitly mention the International Criminal Court and
the Rome Statute. However, given its purpose and the
vital importance of its unanimous adoption, the
sponsors felt justified in reaching the difficult decisions
made during the negotiating process, culminating in the
adoption of this instrument.
I wish finally to indicate that, thanks to the
dedication of humanitarian workers of the United
Nations and of civil society organizations around the
world, thousands upon thousands of people are
protected in extreme conflict situations. We owe it to
them to support and to create better security conditions.
In particular, since the events of 19 August in Baghdad,
the Council owes it to them to shoulder the clear and
resolute responsibility to demonstrate its appreciation
of their work and its solidarity with them.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.
