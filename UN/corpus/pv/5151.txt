The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Sudan in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Erwa
(Sudan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
documents S/2005/57 and addendum 1, S/2005/68 and
S/2005/140, containing the reports of the Secretary-
General dated 31 January, 4 February and 4 March
2005, as well as document S/2005/60, containing a
letter dated 31 January 2005 from the Secretary-
General transmitting the report of the International
Commission of Inquiry on Darfur.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2005/198, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1590 (2005).
I give the floor to Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno,
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.
Mr. Guéhenno: I will make this statement to the
Security Council on behalf of the Secretary-General.
“Let me start by welcoming the Council’s
adoption of a resolution authorizing the
establishment of the United Nations Mission in
Sudan (UNMIS). We look to UNMIS to play a
key role in assisting the implementation of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, signed on 9
January between the Government of Sudan and
the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement.
“This is a crucial moment for the Sudan,
and a decisive one for the international
community, in the resolution of decades of civil
war in Africa’s largest country. I am heartened
that, after lengthy deliberations by the Council,
the text takes into account proposals that I made
in my January report.
“Those proposals were based on a thorough
analysis of what we believe is required from the
international community to give effective support
3
S/PV.5151
for the implementation of the Peace Agreements.
Although there are some areas where the
resolution does not match my recommendations,
we in the Secretariat are prepared to fulfil our
obligations.
“But let us be clear: the people of the
Sudan, the donor community and the United
Nations face extraordinary challenges in
implementing the Peace Agreement. These must
be addressed quickly and with determination.
Serious political hurdles still confront the peace
process, and we must have the full cooperation of
the parties to overcome them.
“Moreover, we will face unprecedented
logistical obstacles in establishing a United
Nations peace support operation in a country
famous for its extreme climate and prohibitive
terrain.
“The United Nations is looking to members
of the international community — in particular
those who have already generously supported the
peace process and humanitarian relief — to
provide further sustained assistance in key areas.
These include security sector reform; the return
and reintegration of internally displaced persons;
the disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration of combatants; and longer-term
economic development.
“Recovering from more than 20 years of
civil war will be a lengthy and a costly process.
Yet even the United Nations appeal for $560
million to cover immediate funding of relief and
recovery in the south remains woefully
underfunded, with only 10 per cent pledged or
contributed so far.
“Next month’s meeting in Oslo will be an
important test of our commitment. But we need
immediate and generous support even before
that — especially with the approach of the rainy
season, which threatens to impede our operations.
“The resolution that the Council has
adopted today rightly expresses the Council’s
utmost concern over the dire consequences of the
prolonged conflict in Darfur. I welcome the
Council’s explicit wish to reinforce efforts to
foster peace in Darfur, especially through support
by UNMIS for the African Union mission.
“I have just received the preliminary report
of the assessment mission led by the African
Union, in which the United Nations also
participated. I am studying the report and will
hold urgent consultations with Chairperson
Konaré before making recommendations.
“It is clear that the present state of affairs in
Darfur is unacceptable; its problems are
immediate, and we cannot accept the status quo.
The violence and destruction must stop. Impunity
must end. If security does not improve quickly,
the killings and rapes will continue. We must not
allow this catastrophic scenario to become a
foregone conclusion.
“We must make clear to those responsible
that they will be held accountable. I support the
Council’s efforts to give this message real
meaning. As members are aware, there is a clear
recommendation from the International
Commission of Inquiry on Darfur that the
Security Council immediately refer the situation
to the International Criminal Court. Sanctions
must also be kept on the table.
“While I welcome today’s resolution, I also
look forward to the Council’s decision on these
issues.
“As we meet here today, humanitarian
workers and the African Union mission are on the
front line of the international community’s
response to the Darfur crisis. They are working
together courageously, with dedication and at
great personal risk. The Council owes it to them
to act with courage and determination.
“Our work to help bring peace and stability
to Sudan as a whole is still only beginning. For
the sake of the men, women and children of that
nation, let us all act firmly and decisively to
complete our mission.”
The President: I thank Mr. Guéhenno for the
statement.
I now give the floor to the representative of the
Sudan.
Mr. Erwa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your
assumption of the presidency of the Security Council at
4
S/PV.5151
this very historic time for my country. We are fully
confident that you will carry out your mission well.
I begin my statement by thanking the Council for
all its efforts to support the implementation of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the
Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), which was
reached on 9 January 2005 after a long period of
negotiations in which the Sudan’s position — which
has not changed — was that peace will continue to be a
strategic choice and that every possible sacrifice
should be made to achieve it.
Until we implement that historic Agreement
aimed at ending one of Africa’s longest conflicts and
opening up the prospect of a unified Sudan in which
peace prevails and in which the north, south, east and
west live together in harmony; and until the Agreement
takes effect throughout the Sudan, providing stability
and peace, particularly in the Darfur province — and
we hope that events will continue to move in the right
direction in that regard — we must redouble our efforts
to achieve a comprehensive peace by bringing about
peace and stability in Darfur, as stated before the
Council by the President of the Sudanese Republic and
the leader of the SPLM/A on 8 February.
Now that the Council has adopted resolution
1590 (2005), which sets out the mandate of the United
Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), I should like to
thank in particular the resolution’s sponsors for their
rational approach in defining the Mission’s mandate in
a separate resolution. We fully appreciate the wisdom
of the members of the Council and their cooperation
aimed at ensuring the unanimous adoption of this
resolution so very important and historic for Sudan.
I should like to remind the Council of the pledges
and commitments undertaken at the historic meeting
held in Nairobi on 19 November 2004, including its
commitment to accelerate the adoption of the
resolution on the mission’s mandate and its insistence
that the parties conclude a peace agreement as agreed
at Nairobi. The parties honoured their commitment and
presented the Peace Agreement to the Sudanese people
as a gift at the beginning of the new year, as we
promised. The people of the Sudan expect the United
Nations Mission in Sudan to support the peace. The
beginning of the implementation of this Agreement,
which we have witnessed today, is a very important
first practical step in that regard.
The Government of the Sudan, which has made
every effort to reach peace, is more keen than any other
party to implement the Agreement and translate it into
reality in every province of the Sudan. Here, we should
like to remind the Council that we are a State on the
threshold of development and progress. We have
achieved this peace after having followed a long and
arduous path, and we are now preparing to assume a
number of responsibilities and to work long and hard to
form a government of national unity, to prepare to
implement the Agreement, to undertake efforts in the
areas of repatriation and reconstruction, and to work
intensively to put an end to what has been happening in
Darfur and to enable it to embark on the path of peace
without delay.
I must remind the Council of the importance of
supporting my Government at a time when it is
assuming all of these responsibilities. Needless to say,
one cannot ask the Government to undertake such
important responsibilities while at the same time
weakening it or limiting its capacities. History is our
witness.
At the end of this historic meeting, I must
commend the efforts of the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development (IGAD), the Troika States
and the IGAD Partners Forum, as well as the very
important position taken by the sisterly State of Kenya.
We also commend the efforts undertaken by the
African Union under the leadership of Nigeria.
I wish to reiterate that the Government of the
Sudan, which has made every sacrifice to reach this
Agreement, is firmly committed to its implementation.
We will continue to work towards that end, and we will
not look back until the benefits of peace are felt
throughout the Sudan.
The President: There are no further speakers on
my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 5.10 p.m.
