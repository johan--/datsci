capacity as President of the Council, I have met with
the representatives of the parties, who have confirmed
to me that they maintain their well-known positions
vis-à-vis the item on the Council ‘s agenda. On the
basis of those meetings, as President, with the consent

If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
