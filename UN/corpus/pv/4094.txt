The President: The Security Council will now begin

consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/2000/52, which contains the text
of a letter dated 26 January 2000 from the Russian
Federation, transmitting the decision of the Council of
Heads of State of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) on further measures for the settlement of the conflict
in Abkhazia, Georgia.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. If I
hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the

There being no objection, it is so decided.
