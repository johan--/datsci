The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Letter dated 18 April 2006 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the
Security Council (S/2006/248)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Lebanon, in which she requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Ms. Ziade
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/248, which contains the text of a
letter dated 18 April 2006 from the Secretary-General,
transmitting the third semi-annual report on the
implementation of resolution 1559 (2004).
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/298, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Denmark, France,
Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
I wish to draw members’ attention to document
S/2006/259, containing the text of a letter dated 24
April 2006 from the Syrian Arab Republic addressed to
the Secretary-General.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Congo, Denmark, France, Ghana,
Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Slovakia, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United Republic of Tanzania, United States of
America
Against:
None
Abstentions:
China, Russian Federation
The President (spoke in French): The result of
the voting is as follows: 13 votes in favour, none
against and 2 abstentions. The draft resolution has
therefore been adopted as resolution 1680 (2006).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council wishing to make a statement following the
voting.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation has consistently
advocated the strengthening of stability in Lebanon and
the normalization of the situation in Syria, thereby
promoting relations of equality and genuine good-
neighbourliness between those countries in the
interests of the Lebanese and Syrian peoples and
strengthening security in the region.
We are convinced that Lebanon’s sovereignty,
unity and territorial integrity can be strengthened
exclusively through dialogue between Damascus and
Beirut. Moreover, recent positive progress in the
settlement of a number of border issues between the
two countries clearly demonstrates that the
opportunities exist to do so.
Today’s resolution is a departure from the
aforementioned tasks. It does not help to achieve a
constructive settlement of the issues pending between
the two countries or to further establish mutual
understanding between them. The Russian delegation
did not see any particular need at this stage for any
further substantive reaction on the part of the Security
Council on issues related to Syrian-Lebanese relations.
Nevertheless, we expressed our willingness to
agree to an official presidential statement, offering our
own amendments and proposals. Unfortunately, the
3
S/PV.5440
sponsors of the resolution did not take those duly into
account and full agreement could not be reached. The
sponsors’ approach was not in line with the established
practice of the Security Council and should not set a
precedent in this principal organ for the maintenance of
international peace and security.
On that basis, the Russian Federation found it
impossible to support the resolution.
Mr. D’Alotto (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation wishes to explain its vote in favour of
resolution 1680 (2006), which the Council has just
adopted.
My delegation supports the implementation of all
the provisions of resolution 1559 (2004), which
remains the basic text to guide the work of the Security
Council on this issue. In that regard, my country does
not believe it necessary to reinterpret the operative
paragraphs of that resolution or to keep saddling the
parties with additional obligations. In our opinion, we
must pursue the implementation of that resolution and
find a satisfactory solution to such issues as the
disarmament and disbanding of the Lebanese militias
and the extension of Lebanese authority throughout the
territory of the country. For us, the best way to resolve
those problems is through the Lebanese national
dialogue that began last March.
My delegation believes that the language of
paragraph 4 of today’s resolution should be interpreted
in the light of the relevant provisions of international
law on diplomatic affairs. The Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations is specific in its determination
that the establishment of diplomatic relations and
mutual diplomatic representation must take place
through mutual consent of the States involved. My
country does not believe that the Security Council
should become involved in these matters, which are
solely of a bilateral nature. Argentina believes that
paragraph 4 of today’s resolution does not establish a
precedent that could be invoked in the future on this
issue or on other agenda items of the Council. We shall
continue to affirm that the establishment of diplomatic
relations and the delimitation of borders are matters
which should be decided by the States involved
through dialogue and negotiation without external
interference.
We encourage Lebanon and Syria to move
forward in the coming months along this path, and we
welcome the statement of high-level Syrian officials in
that regard.
In the process of negotiating this draft resolution,
my delegation put forward a number of amendments in
order to spell out the aforementioned position. A
number of our suggestions were accepted by the
sponsors and my country was therefore able to vote in
favour of the draft resolution. Let me emphasize,
however, that my delegation will insist that any future
Security Council action on the basis of this resolution
should be fully consistent with the relevant provisions
of international law. It should not exceed the
framework defined in the operative part of resolution
1559 (2004).
Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese): It
has been the consistent view of China that the principle
of respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial
integrity and non-interference in domestic affairs
should be upheld in international relations. That is also
the core principle in the foreign policy of China. It is
also a fundamental principle established in the United
Nations Charter. China fully understands and supports
the desire and demand of Lebanon to establish
diplomatic relations and to define its borders with its
neighbours. We sincerely hope that Lebanon and Syria
will continue bilateral dialogue so that an appropriate
solution can be gradually found.
In the light of that, China hoped that the sponsors
of today’s draft resolution would make corresponding
changes to the draft text so that consensus could be
reached in the Council and a positive, balanced and
constructive message could be sent out. We have taken
note, with appreciation, of the efforts made by the
sponsors. Regrettably, the changes made did not
resolve our fundamental concerns. Therefore, China
was obliged to abstain in the voting on the draft
resolution.
At present, Lebanon is at a crucial historical
turning point. We congratulate the Government and the
people of Lebanon on the progress that they have
made. We sincerely hope that stability and unity can be
maintained in Lebanon, which would not only
contribute to domestic security and development but
would promote the peace and stability of its neighbours
and of the entire Middle East region.
All external help should be offered with a
constructive attitude. It should take into full
consideration the sensitivity and complexity of the
4
S/PV.5440
issues concerned and should avoid adding new
elements of instability. China is ready to join the rest of
the international community in a common effort to find
solutions to questions between Palestine and Israel,
between Syria and Lebanon, and between Lebanon and
Israel, so that a comprehensive, just and lasting peace
can be established in the Middle East at an early date.
Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation voted in favour of draft resolution
S/2006/298. The position of Qatar is firm in its respect
for the sovereignty, political independence and
territorial integrity of Lebanon. Our position calls for
full respect for Lebanese efforts to resolve difficult
national problems through the Lebanese national
dialogue. In that regard, my delegation stresses that it
welcomes that dialogue and that it encourages all the
parties to strive to make progress concerning relations
between Lebanon and Syria.
We affirm that, ultimately, the depth of historical
relations and the common geography of the two
neighbouring countries cannot permit any tension to
overcome the friendly relations between the two
countries. Parties to the national dialogue were
unanimous in calling for positive and friendly relations
between the two States, based on mutual respect.
Furthermore, the high-level committees formed jointly
by the two countries indicate the mutual respect
between the two countries and their efforts to resolve
all bilateral issues between them in a manner that does
not touch upon the sovereignty of either.
On another front, we regret that the resolution did
not mention any breaches by Israel of the Blue Line.
These are among the elements that are hampering the
full implementation of resolution 1559 (2004), not to
mention the fact that they are a breach of Lebanon’s
sovereignty and territorial integrity, as the Secretary-
General has stated in his reports to the Security
Council.
The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers on my list. The Security Council has
thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of
the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.35 a.m.
