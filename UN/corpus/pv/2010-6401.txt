Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/520, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by the United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, France,
Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
Against:
None
Abstaining:
China
The President: There were 14 votes in favour,
none against and 1 abstention. The draft resolution has
been adopted as resolution 1945 (2010).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council wishing to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Yang Tao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation abstained in the voting on the
resolution just adopted. China has serious concerns
over the annual report submitted by the Panel of
Experts on the Sudan, and believes that there is much
room for improvement in the work of the Panel. We
urge the Panel of Experts to conduct its work under the
principles of objectivity and responsibility.
The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain
seized of the matter
