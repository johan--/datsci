The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Liberia
Report of the Secretary-General to the Security
Council on Liberia (S/2003/875)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Liberia in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kawah
(Liberia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Kofi Annan, at this meeting.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council
on Liberia, document S/2003/875.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2003/898, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared earlier.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by a show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1509 (2003).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.
