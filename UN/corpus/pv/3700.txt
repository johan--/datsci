tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency Mr.

The situation in the former Yugoslavia
The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbey

Representative for the Implementation of the Peace

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
