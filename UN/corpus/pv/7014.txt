The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations operation in Cyprus
(S/2013/392)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2013/441, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2013/392, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations operation in
Cyprus.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
IshouldliketoinformtheCouncilthatthepresidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of
the parties, who have confirmed that they maintain
their well-known positions vis-à-vis the item on the
Council’s agenda. On the basis of those meetings,
with the consent of the members of the Council, the
presidency has drawn the conclusion that the Council
can proceed to take a decision on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Australia, China, France, Guatemala,
Luxembourg, Morocco, Republic of Korea, Russian
Federation, Rwanda, Togo, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United
States of America
Abstaining:
Azerbaijan, Pakistan
The President: There were 13 votes in favour, none
against and two abstentions. The draft resolution has
been adopted as resolution 2114 (2013).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Masood Khan (Pakistan): We thank the
United Kingdom for preparing resolution 2114 (2013)
on the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) and for steering its delicate negotiating
process.
Pakistan welcomes the first interaction between the
leaders of the two sides in Cyprus in May this year and
the prospects of the commencement of the negotiating
process later this year. Pakistan supports Cyprus-led
and Cyprus-owned negotiations. We hope that both
parties will direct their efforts towards a results-
oriented process leading to a durable settlement. We
support the efforts of the Security Council and the good
offices mission.
As for the resolution just adopted, we had made
a number of suggestions to ensure a fair balance in
the draft. Some suggestions were taken on board, and
we deeply appreciate that. However, a reference to
joint statements, including those of 23 May and July
2008, was deleted. That constrained us to abstain in
the voting on the draft resolution. Our abstention is
without prejudice to our support for the extension of
UNFICYP’s mandate and the early commencement of
negotiations.
We support the essential objectives of the resolution.
Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): I should like briefly
to share with the Council the reasoning behind our
abstention in the voting on resolution 2114 (2013).
First of all, we would like to express our gratitude
to the delegation of the United Kingdom for its
leadership and efforts in facilitating the negotiations on
the resolution. Azerbaijan fully supports the Secretary-
General’s good offices mission and the six-month
mandate renewal of the United Nations Peacekeeping
Force in Cyprus. At the same time, similarly to our
approach taken with regard to previous resolutions
on the issue, both conceptual and some textual
considerations again prevented us from voting in favour
of the resolution.
We believe that achieving a mutually acceptable
and comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem,
within the established United Nations parameters, is
possible and within reach. The resolution just adopted
urges the sides to resume their substantive negotiations
and continue their discussions to reach decisive

The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
I would like to express the sincere appreciation of
the delegation of the United States to the members of
the Council and to the secretariat of the Council for all
the support they have given to us this month. Indeed,
it has been a busy month and one in which we rallied
to consensus on several important issues within our
purview. We could not have done it without the hard
work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat, as
well as the interpreters, translators, meeting services
staff and sound engineers.
As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of Argentina
good luck in the month of August.
The meeting rose at 10.30 a.m.
progress on the core issues, and stresses that the status
quo is unsustainable.
However, in our view, the resolution does not
provide a full and proper update of the situation and
does not place the required emphasis on the necessity
to agree on a results-oriented process. Furthermore, as
a result of the efforts aimed at finding a compromise
rather than reflecting the factual situation, certain
provisions of the resolution do not accurately describe
some of the developments on the ground. This is the
case, for example, with regard to paragraph 5 of the
resolution, in which it would be essential to welcome
not only the efforts to accommodate the Committee on
Missing Persons exhumation requirements, but also the
actual access granted to that end.
For the reasons I have just cited, Azerbaijan decided
to abstain in the voting on resolution 2014 (2013).
