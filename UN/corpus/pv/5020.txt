The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the members of Council that I have received
a letter from the representative of Iraq, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ahmad

The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

of resolution 1483 (2003) and paragraph 12 of resolution

S/2004/625.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2004/637, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
I should also like to draw the attention of the
members of the Council to document S/2004/590,
which contains the text of a letter dated 23 July 2004
from Egypt addressed to the President of the Security
Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/2004/637)
