The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Sierra Leone
Seventh report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office
in Sierra Leone (S/2011/554)
The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representative of Sierra Leone to
participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/572, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2011/554, which contains the seventh
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America
The President (spoke in Arabic): The draft
resolution received 15 votes in favour. The draft
resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution
2005 (2011).
I now give the floor to the representative of
Sierra Leone.
Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): I have only asked for
the floor to express our sincere gratitude to the
Security Council for unanimously adopting resolution
2005 (2011) this morning, on the extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Integrated
Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone. It is indeed a
reflection of the solidarity and commitment of the
Council to ensuring that the gains so far made in our
peacebuilding efforts are kept on track, and not
derailed.
A few days ago, my Foreign Minister addressed
the Council (S/PV.6609). I believe that he reaffirmed
that, in addition to our existing political will and
commitment, there is an interest on the part of all right-
thinking people and citizens of the country, State and
non-State actors in general, to ensure a smooth and
successful outcome to the 2012 elections and to help
gravitate the country from a peacebuilding mode to a
development and growth mode.
At this juncture, I would solicit the Council’s
assistance and cooperation to that end, including that
of all right-thinking people and international players.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
