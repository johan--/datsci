S/PV.4683
The meeting was called to order at 12.05 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation between Iraq and Kuwait
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2002/1397, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Bulgaria, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.
I should to draw attention to the following
changes to Annex A of the draft resolution. Page 3,
item (4) should read ‚Äú1.A.4.d: Quantities of activated
carbon, that have been tested and certified effective for
chemical weapons agent absorption, that exceed the
established consumption rates‚Äù. On page 5, item (10)
should read as follows: ‚Äú1.2.14: Hantaviruses; 1.2.53:
Lumpy Skin Disease virus‚Äù.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution, as orally
revised in its provisional form. Unless I hear any
objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote
now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Colombia, France,
Guinea, Ireland, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway,
Singapore, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America
Abstaining:
Russian Federation, Syrian Arab Republic
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 13
votes in favour, none against and 2 abstentions. The
draft resolution, as orally revised in its provisional
form, has been adopted as resolution 1454 (2002).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): Russia has always considered the United
Nations humanitarian programme in Iraq an
opportunity to satisfy the basic needs of that country‚Äôs
civilian population with the assistance of the
international community. Given the continuing trade
embargo, it is the only way to solve Iraq‚Äôs
humanitarian problems. We hope that, as the relevant
Security Council resolutions are implemented with the
full cooperation of the Iraqi side, a prospect will open
for the suspension and then the lifting of sanctions.
That moment has not yet come, and therefore the
uninterrupted delivery of major humanitarian goods to
Iraq is of vital importance.
The resolution just adopted by the Security
Council provides for the introduction of a number of
adjustments in the way in which humanitarian
deliveries to Iraq are carried out, pertaining to the
Goods Review List and procedures for its application.
Russia was unable to support the draft resolution and
thus abstained from voting. We note that, in the course
of the consultations that preceded today‚Äôs vote, the
draft resolution‚Äôs text became more balanced. In
particular, it now includes an important observation
that, in future, review of the List will cover not only
additions of new elements but also deletions of entries.
We hope that the Office of the Iraq Programme, the
United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission and the International Atomic Energy
Agency, taking the experience of resolution 1409
(2002) fully into account, will make recommendations
with regard to corrections to the List and procedures
with a view to facilitating the flow of humanitarian
goods to Iraq.
It is of key importance that the resolution
provides for the possible lifting of sanctions. However,
the consultations that were held did not enable us to
take various views ‚Äî including proposals by the
Russian Federation ‚Äî fully into account. We believe
that some wording in the List imposes too many
restrictions and affects not only dual-use goods but also
goods that are exclusively civilian in nature. We should
especially like to recall that we believe the limitations
on trucking and transport vehicles to be unjustifiably
harsh, as such vehicles are necessary for ensuring
normal civilian transportation.
In that context, we are seriously concerned at
information that came recently to the Secretariat that,
in the Security Council Committee established pursuant
3
S/PV.4683
to resolution 661 (1990) concerning the situation
between Iraq and Kuwait, virtually all requests made
by Iraq for truck transport and for trucking equipment
have been blocked. This trend has a very negative
impact on the possibility of full distribution of
humanitarian goods to the Iraqi population and is
further complicating an already difficult situation in
such important sectors of the economy as water supply,
electric power, irrigation and oil refining.
However, we decided not to object to the
adoption of the resolution, based on the fact that the
Goods Review List is not a denial list, but only one
that provides for the adoption in the sanctions
Committee of well-considered and valid ‚Äî and this
includes from the humanitarian standpoint ‚Äî decisions
on specific contracts. We trust that in future all the
members of the sanctions Committee will take a
constructive approach in considering such requests.
Our view of future work and of the improvement of the
Goods Review List and procedures will, to a significant
extent, depend on the effectiveness of the activities of
the sanctions Committees in approving humanitarian
and other types of civilian goods.
Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in
Arabic): The Syrian Arab Republic delegation
abstained in the voting on resolution 1454 (2002), just
adopted by the Council. Here, we would like to make a
number of points. First, when voting in favour of
resolution 1447 (2002) calling for the extension of the
oil-for-food programme, Syria took into account the
need to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people and
the need to meet its needs, especially basic
humanitarian needs. Syria feels that Iraq‚Äôs cooperation
with the United Nations weapons inspectors and its
positive approach to resolution 1441 (2002) should
inevitably lead to the lifting of the sanctions imposed
on that country and not to the sanctions regime being
complicated by the addition of further restrictions
under the pretext that certain goods can be of dual use.
Secondly, the haste of the negotiations which led
to a vote on the draft resolution did not allow Syria
enough time to study the Goods Review List,
considering the complex technical nature of these
goods, the examination of which requires a high level
of technical expertise and adequate time. Therefore,
Syria was unable to vote in favour of the draft
resolution. We could not fully examine its implications
so as to ensure that it would not have an adverse
impact on the interests of the Iraqi population.
Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): In
adopting resolution 1447 (2002) on 4 December, the
Security Council committed itself to doing everything
possible to review the contents of the Goods Review
List, as well as the procedures for its implementation
within 30 days. Today the Council has achieved this.
To our way of thinking, more time could have
been provided for negotiation so that the Council
would have been able to speak in unity. We also have
questions, to say the least, regarding the method by
which this negotiation was conducted, or, at least,
begun.
However, France voted in favour of the draft
resolution, because in substance it respects the
fundamental objective of the Goods Review List: to
alleviate the suffering and to improve the humanitarian
situation of the Iraqi population, while avoiding the
import by Iraq of dual-use goods. We also note that the
resolution provides that the Goods Review List and the
procedures for its implementation can be reviewed very
soon and at regular intervals.
For our part, we retain the option of making use
of that opportunity in order to advance, as far as may
seem desirable, the deletion of items and the easing of
the procedures.
Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation is in favour of adjustments to the
Goods Review List and the relevant procedures with a
view to improving the humanitarian situation in Iraq.
In this spirit, we took part in the consultations on the
draft resolution and proposed a number of
amendments. We note that China‚Äôs amendments have
basically been reflected in the text. The text in general
is quite balanced, and that is why China voted in
favour of the draft resolution.
We have also noted the positions of other
members. We, too, believe that if there had been time
for further exchanges of views among members, it
would have been possible to achieve a better result.
What must be pointed out is that the current Goods
Review List and procedures are not perfect. They need
to benefit from the common experience we have gained
through our practice. We hope that, in our future
periodic reviews, the Goods Review List and
procedures will be further adjusted and improved so as
to better meet the humanitarian needs of Iraq and to
ensure normal economic exchanges and trade between
Iraq and other countries.

The President (spoke in Spanish): Before I
adjourn this meeting, which we all hope will be the last
of the year, I should like once again to thank all my
colleagues from each and every delegation, and, most
especially, to express our gratitude to the entire
Secretariat team for the support they have provided
over the last two years and, in particular, during the
past month. Likewise, I would express our appreciation
to all the interpreters, who, I am sure, have been put to
the test by those of us who have, perhaps, given them
somewhat more work in this important task.
Finally, let me wish everyone very happy
holidays and my very best wishes for the year 2003.
There are no further speakers on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.
