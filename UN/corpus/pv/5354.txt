The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Côte d’Ivoire
Seventh progress report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Operation in
Côte d’Ivoire (S/2006/2)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Côte d’Ivoire, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Yao
(Côte d’Ivoire) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/2, which contains the seventh
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/41, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s prior
consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to photocopies of a letter dated
23 January 2006 from the representative of Côte
d’Ivoire addressed to the President of the Security
Council, which will be issued as document S/2006/43.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2006/41) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall
now put the draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.
