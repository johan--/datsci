The meeting was called to order at 5.25 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Letter dated 12 December 2005 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the President of
the Security Council (S/2005/775)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Lebanon and the Syrian Arab
Republic in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Assaf
(Lebanon) and Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab
Republic) took seats at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
photocopies of a letter dated 12 December 2005 from
the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the
Security Council transmitting the report of the United
Nations International Independent Investigation
Commission prepared pursuant to resolutions 1595
(2005) and 1636 (2005). The letter and its enclosure
will be issued as a document of the Security Council
under the symbol S/2005/775.
I should like to draw the attention of members to
documents S/2005/762 and S/2005/783, which contain
letters dated 5 December and 13 December 2005,
respectively, from the chargé d’affaires ad interim of
the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United
Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/788, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.
I welcome the presence at this meeting of the
Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1644 (2005).
I shall now give the floor to those representatives
who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): Algeria
has vigorously condemned the assassination of
Mr. Rafik Hariri ever since the commission of that
abominable crime and has insisted that light be shed on
the matter and that the perpetrators, whoever they are
and wherever they might be, be brought to justice.
Those concerns prompted us to play an active
role in the negotiations that led to the Security
Council’s unanimous adoption of resolution 1595
(2005), which established the international
Commission responsible for helping the Lebanese to
establish the facts. We helped to ensure that the
Commission had the full support of the Security
Council and that it would be able to carry out its
mission with full independence. Similarly, during
negotiations on resolution 1636 (2005), we strove to
provide the Commission with the means and resources
to enable it fulfil its mandate and to ensure the full
cooperation of all the parties concerned.
The Council has just considered the second
progress report. The report’s conclusions are not final,
3
S/PV.5329
and need to be corroborated. We are convinced that, in
order to safeguard the credibility of the report and the
work of the Commission, consideration of the report
must be free from any influence that could harm one
party or another. In this regard, we welcome the
agreement reached concerning the location and
conditions for hearing the Syrian witnesses, as well as
the cooperation shown by Syria — and borne out in
actions — and we urge it to continue in the same
direction and, in particular, to comply with resolution
1636 (2005). The letters recently addressed by Syria to
the Security Council confirm that willingness to
cooperate.
We also note with satisfaction the readiness of the
Council to give positive consideration to the request
for the expansion of the mandate of the Commission
investigating the assassination of Mr. Hariri to consider
the other attacks that have taken place since 1 October
2004. We have fully supported that request, first of all
because it came directly from the Lebanese
Government, but also because there could be links
between the various attacks that have taken place in
Lebanon. Although not completely satisfactory, the
wording agreed upon by the Security Council relating
to that request and to the establishment of a tribunal of
an international character constitutes a clear
commitment on the part of the international community
to Lebanon, and we can therefore welcome it.
Finally, we have sought and obtained assurances
that the Security Council will refrain from any
premature or inappropriate action, given the stage that
the investigation has reached and the common
objectives that we are pursuing. That is why, while
pointing out that the language in the resolution just
adopted concerning the degree of cooperation by Syria
with the Investigation Commission does not do justice
to the goodwill that has been shown by that country,
we nevertheless chose to preserve the unity of the
Council and voted in favour of the text that was
submitted.
Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
We have taken note of the report submitted to the
Security Council by Mr. Mehlis, head of the
International Independent Investigation Commission.
The Commission is making fresh headway in its
investigation, but it has not yet finished its work. Much
remains to be done. We have also taken note of the
recent request by Lebanon, and we express our full
understanding in that respect.
The main purpose of resolution 1644 (2005),
which the Council has just adopted, is to extend the
mandate of the International Independent Investigation
Commission so that it can continue to assist the
Lebanese Government in establishing the facts
regarding the assassination of Mr. Hariri. For those
reasons, China voted in favour of resolution 1644
(2005). We hope that, given the efforts and cooperation
of all the parties concerned, the Commission will soon
uncover the truth of the matter.
Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): Right up until the time of today’s vote, the
members of the Council continued to work on the draft
resolution containing the response of the Security
Council to the latest report of the Mehlis Commission.
We had very much hoped that Council members would
be able to overcome their differences of opinion and
reach a consensus on that document. Despite the
continuing divergences of view, we were able to come
to an agreement, and the resolution was adopted
unanimously.
We proposed our own amendments to the texts
prepared by our French and American colleagues,
which made it more balanced in nature, without,
however, fully freeing it of negativism with respect to
Syria — unnecessary in the current situation. We
continue to oppose unwarranted pressure on Damascus,
as well as interpretations with respect to the degree and
nature of Syrian cooperation with international
investigators that are not in keeping with the
conclusions of the Mehlis Commission.
We have noted that Damascus began cooperating
with the Mehlis Commission on the basis of the
provisions of resolution 1636 (2005). So far, the Syrian
side has taken only initial steps in that respect; it still
has considerable distance to cover.
The Security Council must monitor the manner in
which the Syrian side meets its obligations and, where
necessary, assist it.
We would also reiterate Russia’s firm conviction
of the need to continue efforts to establish the facts
with respect to the circumstances surrounding the death
of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri.
The President: I give the floor to the
representative of Lebanon.
Mr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like to begin by thanking the Security Council for
4
S/PV.5329
having adopted resolution 1644 (2005) unanimously.
The adoption by the Council of this resolution is proof
of the Council’s commitment to helping Lebanon in the
very difficult circumstances in which our country finds
itself. This is in accordance with the Council’s
responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security, in particular in the light of the
terrorist bombings that took place in Lebanon between
1 October 2004 — the date of the attempted
assassination of Minister Marwan Hamadeh — and the
time of the assassination of Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, as well as other attacks, including the terrorist
bombing the day before yesterday that claimed the life
of Gibran Tueni, who was a Member of Parliament.
We thank the Security Council for its
commitment and assure it that the Lebanese people will
continue to steadfastly face all of the challenges and
dangers inherent in preserving the unity, stability and
independence of Lebanon. We will not turn back on
this path.
The President: I give the floor to the
representative of the Syrian Arab Republic.
Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in
Arabic): I should like to express my appreciation for
this opportunity to make a few brief comments on the
resolution just adopted by the Security Council.
I should like at the outset to express my country’s
appreciation for the efforts made by many States
members of the Council to prevent the adoption of a
resolution contravening international law, the
principles of the Charter and the role of the Security
Council in the maintenance of international peace and
security.
I would like to reiterate that, despite the full
cooperation shown by Syria within the framework of
its sovereignty and the rights of its citizens, in
accordance with international law and humanitarian
law, certain States, because of their narrow interests,
insisted on saying that we have not positively
cooperated with the International Independent
Investigation Commission or with respect to the
implementation of the relevant resolutions in a record
short time, even though many of the resolutions on the
Middle East that have been adopted over the past 38
years have yet to be implemented.
It is regrettable that, although we have clearly
stated that contacts between Syria and the Commission
were under way and that efforts were being made by
both sides to reach mutual agreement on issues relating
to the questioning of Syrian citizens, some have chosen
to overlook everything we have stated, have reached
selective conclusions based on the Commission’s
report, and have used them in a distorted way against
my country.
Syria has discharged its responsibilities in a spirit
of sincerity, certain as it was that a professional and
objective investigation would lead to Syria’s being
cleared. We have not cooperated with the Commission
just to please certain parties, but because we wanted to
cooperate.
During the preceding period, we informed the
Council, via letters to all of its members, about all of
our actions and efforts. Regrettably, some Council
members did not even want to take note of these
letters.
To bring pressure to bear and to attempt to
impose one’s will on others runs counter to the
principles governing relations among States, which
must be based on mutual respect, constructive dialogue
and openness to others.
Lastly, let me reiterate Syria’s firm commitment
fully to cooperate with the Commission during the
coming period.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 5.50 p.m.
