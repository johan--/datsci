The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Croatia, in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council’s agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nobilo
(Croatia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council
resolution 1066 (1996), document S/1996/1075.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1997/29, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s prior
consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents:
S/1996/884, letter dated 28 October 1996 from the Chargé
d’affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of
Yugoslavia to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General; and S/1996/974, letter dated 25
November 1996 from the Chargé d’affaires ad interim of
the Permanent Mission of Croatia to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/1997/29)
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
