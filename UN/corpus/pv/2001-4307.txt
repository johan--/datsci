Statement by the President
The President: Since this is the last public
meeting of the month and my last appearance before
the Council in my current capacity, I wish to extend to
all of the members of the Security Council and to all
delegations our sincerest thanks for their efforts in
assisting the Ukrainian presidency of the Council at all
stages of the implementation of the programme we
proposed for this month and beyond, for their spirit of
goodwill and cooperation and for their good and
thoughtful advice, even before our presidency started. I
will be leaving New York with the feeling of ‚Äúmission
accomplished‚Äù.
On behalf of my delegation, I also wish to thank
the Secretariat and all the departments that once again
displayed their traditional, unfailing readiness to
provide us with very useful and detailed information.
We also extend our thanks to the entire team led by
Mr. Stephanides for their advice, professionalism,
discipline and willingness to work literally 24 hours a
day, including on weekends. We are particularly
grateful for their always active and unwavering
assistance in preparations for the Ukrainian presidency.
I also wish to convey our most cordial gratitude to the
interpreters for their wonderful performance during
these long hours and days of our presidency.
I wish every success to the delegation of the
United Kingdom, which will be assuming this seat in
the coming days. They, like us, will appreciate
members‚Äô fullest cooperation.
Expression of thanks to the outgoing President
Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): I
want to break with tradition, Mr. President, since you
will not be present with us next week, and to express
the Council‚Äôs pleasure at having you preside over our
formal meetings during the month of March, as our
colleague and as a close friend of all of us around the
table. It has given us delight to have you among us and
leading us with such clarity, calmness and wisdom
during the month of March. I wish to congratulate you
on that, Mr. President, on behalf of all the other
members of the Council, and to wish to you all good
fortune upon your return to your capital.
The President: I thank the representative of the
United Kingdom for his kind words addressed to me.
