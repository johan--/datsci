President of the Security Council (S/2012/926)

Mr. Coulibaly (Mali) (spoke in French): First of
all, I would like to express the sincere gratitude of
myself and the delegation of Mali for the convening
of this important meeting, which is the culmination of
the tireless commendable efforts we have made in the
search for a lasting solution to the serious crisis that
Mali is currently experiencing. In that connection,
Morocco‚Äôs presidency of the Security Council has
served to move forward the process of resolving
the crisis in Mali. That is reflected in the Council‚Äôs
meeting on 5 December on the situation in the Sahel
(see S/PV.6879), during which the Council considered
the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in
Mali (S/2012/894), as well as in the open debate held on
10 December (see S/PV.6882).
The Security Council has taken a historic step
today in unanimously adopting resolution 2085 (2012),
which, under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United
Nations, authorizes the deployment of an international
force under African leadership to help Mali‚Äôs military
and police forces to restore State sovereignty and
territorial integrity in the areas of Gao, Timbuktu
and Kidal, which are controlled by the terrorists and
extremists of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM),
the Mouvement pour l‚Äôunicit√© et le jihad en Afrique de
l‚ÄôOuest (MUJAO) and affiliated groups. Mali welcomes
the adoption of this resolution, which reflects the
commitment of the international community to stand
by Mali in combating terrorism and transnational
organized crime, which gravely imperil the region‚Äôs
stability as well as international peace and security.
The Government of Mali commits itself to
cooperate fully with the Security Council and to fulfil
its obligations under this resolution. In that regard, I
would like to reiterate here our determination to pursue,
under the auspices of the Economic Community of West
African States mediator, the discussions that have been
initiated with Malian rebel groups that have decided to
break all ties with AQMI, MUJAO and their affiliated
terrorist and extremist groups, as well as to definitively
reject violence and the notion of secession. Needless
to say, political dialogue cannot begin outside the
framework of non-negotiable conditions set out by the
Government of Mali, which includes strict respect for
Mali‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity, the secular
nature of the State and the unity of the country.
Allow me to take this opportunity, on behalf of
the President of the Republic of Mali, His Excellency
Mr. Dioncounda Traor√©, and of the Government of
The meeting was called to order at 3.25 p.m.

S/PV.6898
Mali, to thank the members of the Security Council for
their tireless efforts in adopting today‚Äôs resolution, to
the great happiness of all of Mali‚Äôs people ‚Äî and in
particular our people under occupation and those who
have been displaced or become refugees. I would in
particular like to thank France, its people, President
and Government, who very early on understood that
the presence in northern Mali of heavily armed AQMI,
MUJAO and affiliated extremists and terrorists posed
an immediate threat to international peace and security.
France spared no effort in ensuring that the Security
Council assumed its responsibilities.
I cannot conclude without expressing the deep
gratitude of Mali‚Äôs authorities to the Economic
Community of West African States, the African Union,
the European Union, the United Nations, our bilateral
and multilateral partners, our neigbouring countries
and all the States of the region for their solidarity and
support in the process of resolving the crisis in Mali.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the
floor to the representative of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire.
Mr. Bamba (C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire) (spoke in French):
In his statement during the Security Council debate
on 10 December, the Minister of State and Minister
for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire,
warned of the imminent threat posed by the increasing
presence of terrorist groups in northern Mali:
‚ÄùNorthern Mali is gradually being transformed
into a sanctuary for terrorist groups engaged, with
total impunity, in the worst possible abuses and
massive violations of human rights. That terrorist
presence threatens every State in West Africa and
the Sahel, but also those of the Maghreb and beyond.
We are talking about a real danger to international
peace and security, which therefore demands a
comprehensive and determined response on the
part of the international community.‚Äù (S/PV.6882,
p. 10)
Resolution 2085 (2012), which the Council has
just adopted and which authorizes the African-led
International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA), is
for us proof that the Council took that warning very
seriously, properly assuming its legal responsibility in
that regard under the Charter of the United Nations.
The resolution provides the necessary international
legitimacy to carry out the necessary actions to restore
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Mali. On
behalf of His Excellency President Alassane Ouattara,
current Chairman of the Council of Ministers of
the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), I should like to express the satisfaction of
ECOWAS at the adoption of this historic resolution that
responds to the expecations of all of Africa in the face
of the tragedy in Mali.
First, I would like to point out that this resolution is
timely. Its adoption before the end of this year is in fact
an outstanding message of hope and solidarity both for
the victimized people of northern Mali, who can now
begin to believe that their nightmare will soon come
to an end, as well as to the millions of people who are
suffering similar violence; they, too, will be able to
believe in the ability of the United Nations to take the
life-saving decisions that will bring them the security
to which they have a right.
Secondly, resolution 2085 (2012) sets out a political
strategy that provides every opportunity for peace. The
strategy is based on the framework agreement agreed
by the Malian parties on 6 April, which was later
endorsed by ECOWAS, the African Union, the United
Nations and all our development partners, with a view
to developing a road map aimed at the full restoration
of the constitutional order and the re-establishment of
national unity, in particular by organizing free, fair and
transparent presidential and legislative elections next
year.
Moreover, resolution 2085 (2012) sends out an
unambiguous political message calling for the military
to refrain from all political activity, for the holding
of an inclusive political dialogue, as well as for the
unrelenting pursuit of negotation and mediation with
both independence-seeking and separatist armed
groups and other groups that have clearly distanced
themselves from terrorist groups.
Thirdly and lastly, resolution 2085 (2012) sets
out a military strategy focused on the deployment
of AFISMA that provides for the following crucial
goals: contributing to rebuilding the Malian armed
forces; operational support to Mali‚Äôs authorities aimed
at retaking the territory under the control of terrorist
and extremist groups; and a transition to stabilize
the security situation with a view to placing security
matters back in the hands of Mali‚Äôs authorities.
It is clear that the noble goals of resolution
2085 (2012) will be achieved only with significant
mobilization and the commensurate international
support. It is for that reason that, together with
4 12-66016
S/PV.6898
the primacy of the Security Council in the maintenance
of peace and security in all parts of the world.
We also wish to commend the high-quality wisdom
and political will shown through the decision of the
members of the Security Council to support the requests
of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) and the African Union by authorizing the
deployment of the African-led International Support
Mission in Mali (AFISMA) for an initial period of one
year. I wish therefore to extend the African Union‚Äôs
appreciation to all the members of the Security Council
for their tireless efforts, resolve and commitment,
which led to the adoption of resolution 2085 (2012).
Recent experience in Darfur and Somalia has
shown that an appropriate United Nations support
package that provides for sustainable and predictable
funding remains a critical element of the success
of any international support mission. We note and
welcome with appreciation the conscientious effort of
the Security Council to address that critical matter, as
reflected in the resolution, and we reiterate the African
Union‚Äôs call on the United Nations to put in place a
support package for the International Support Mission,
to be funded through assessed contributions, and to
establish a trust fund to support the Malian Defence and
Security Forces, given the lead role they are expected
to play in addressing the security challenges in their
country.
In conclusion, the African Union Commission
wishes to recall the press statement issued by the
African Union Peace and Security Council at its 348th
meeting, held on 13 December, which, among other
things,
‚Äúreaffirmed the need for sustained efforts by
both the Malian actors and the international
partners, in order to expedite the resolution of the
multidimensional crisis facing Mali, recalling, in
this regard, the relevance of the strategic concept
for the resolution of the crises in Mali‚Äù.
In the statement, the Council also stressed
‚Äúthat issues of democratic governance, as well
as the negotiation process and the deployment
of AFISMA go hand-in-hand, and are mutually
reinforcing, and that determined efforts should
be made on these two tracks [and] appealed for
the mobilization of humanitarian aid to assist the
increasing numbers of refugees in the neighboring
ECOWAS, the African Union calls for a financial and
logistical support package financed through United
Nations assessed contributions to be quickly agreed by
the Security Council. We believe that will be the only
way to provide the means to ensure the sustainability
and effectiveness of AFISMA‚Äôs action.
ECOWAS welcomes the singular perspective
and agreement on action that has developed between
it and the African Union on the issue of Mali. This
convergence of views has extended to all international
partners, first among which is the Security Council.
On behalf of President Ouattara, I would like to
expres the great gratitude of ECOWAS for the great
sense of responsibility demonstrated by the Council
in unanimously adopting resolution 2085 (2012) to
authorize the deployment of an international force to
Mali to put an end to the presence of terrorist groups in
the north of the country and to restore the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of this very important African
country of the Sahel.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the
floor to Mr. Ant√≥nio.
Mr. Ant√≥nio: At the outset, I wish to thank you,
Mr. President, and through you the members of the
Security Council, for inviting the African Union to
participate in this meeting ‚Äî further eloquent testimony
to the evolving strategic partnership that exists between
the United Nations and the African Union on matters of
peace and security on the continent.
(spoke in French)
I should also like to welcome the presence here
today of His Excellency Mr. Ti√©man Hubert Coulibaly,
Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation of Mali. I thank him for his eloquent
statement. I also welcome the statement just made by my
brother Ambassador Bamba, whose views the African
Union fully supports and who spoke of the elements of
the strategy we have espoused since our meeting here
on 5 December (see S/PV.6879).
(spoke in English)
When we met here on 5 December, our intervention
mirrored a collective sense of urgency and a unified
message for concrete and decisive action to resolve
the crisis in Mali. It is in that context that the African
Union welcomes the adoption today of resolution 2085
(2012) as a major step forward and clear recognition of

The President (spoke in Arabic): There are no more
names inscribed on the list of speakers. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

countries and internally displaced persons within
Mali‚Äù.
Finally, I wish to reaffirm the African Union‚Äôs
continued commitment to working in partnership with
the United Nations, ECOWAS, the countries of the
region and other parners towards the speedy resolution
of the crisis in Mali.
