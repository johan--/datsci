Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Georgia
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation in Abkhazia, Georgia (S/2005/32)
The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Georgia, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kaladze
(Georgia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the situation in
Abkhazia, Georgia, document S/2005/32. I should like to
call the attention of the members to document S/2005/45,
containing the text of a letter dated 26 January 2005 from
the Permanent Representative of Georgia to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council. Members also have before them document
S/2005/48, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council’s prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1582 (2005).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.05 a.m.
