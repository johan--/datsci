Expression of sympathy to the Governments and
peoples of Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and Switzerland
The President: At the outset, I should like, on
behalf of the Council, to express profound sympathy
and condolences to the Governments and peoples of
Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
Switzerland, and to the bereaved families, in
connection with the deaths of two international
humanitarian workers of the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) and four nationals of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, who gave their
lives yesterday in the cause of peace while serving with
the ICRC in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Council strongly condemns the wanton killing of
those humanitarian workers.
I would like to request members to stand and
observe a minute of silence in memory of those six
humanitarian workers who so tragically lost their lives
on 26 April 2001.
The members of the Council observed a minute of
silence.
