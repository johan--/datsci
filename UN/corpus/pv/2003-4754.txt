representative of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual

the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the

There being no objection, it is so decided.

draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
