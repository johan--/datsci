The meeting was called to order at 12 noon.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
Report of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
(S/2007/213)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/240, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United States of
America. Members also have before them document
S/2007/213, the report of the Secretary-General on the
Sudan.
I also wish to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/2007/212, which
contains the text of a letter dated 17 April 2007 from
the President of the Security Council addressed to the
Secretary-General.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall first call on the representative of Qatar,
who wishes to make a statement before the voting.
Mr. Al-Bader (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation wishes to express its appreciation to you,
Mr. President, at the end of your presidency of the
Security Council. During the past month, we have had
before us topics of the utmost importance to
humankind and to the maintenance of international
peace and security. We hope that we have worked to
address them in accordance with what our conscience
dictates.
Since the beginning of its membership of the
Security Council, my delegation has been, and
continues to be, keen to address all issues while
working in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations and international law and positively taking
political considerations into account. That is true with
regard to the Sudan, which initiated the request for
assistance from the United Nations to address some
internal issues that need constructive and transparent
support from the international community.
No one can deny that the Sudan has taken many
positive steps in partnership with the United Nations
and the African Union, as was underscored by the
statement to the press by the President of the Security
Council on 16 April 2007. All that is needed now is
assistance, provided in a manner based on
encouragement and mutual respect, in order to preserve
what has been achieved, build upon it and protect it
from any negative impact.
The purpose of the draft resolution we are about
to adopt is to renew the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), which was established
pursuant to resolution 1590 (2005), regarding the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement in the Sudan. We
would like to thank our colleagues who submitted this
draft resolution. We expressed our comments and
reservations to them after having considered the first
version. We believed that the draft resolution exceeded
its intended purpose and dealt with various issues for
which there are other mechanisms. We also noted that
the language of the draft resolution was not consistent
with the recent positive developments in the
relationship between the Sudan and the United Nations,
which we are very eager to develop.
The divergence of views during the discussion of
the draft resolution in its initial form caused the
Council to fail to reach consensus as the expiration
date of the mandate of UNMIS was approaching. The
delegation of Qatar therefore decided to put forward a
draft resolution calling for a specific technical renewal
of the mandate of UNMIS as an alternative at the
disposal of the Council if necessary. However, in the
very last hours we sensed that there was understanding
and a constructive response from the sponsor of the
draft resolution now before us. We commend that
responsiveness, which has led to a convergence of
views and a settlement that helped us to agree to the
adoption of the draft resolution before us.
In conclusion, my delegation wishes to stress that
it attaches great importance to collective action on the
basis of dealing with each case within its limits,
without combining it with other issues and in
accordance with the principles of professionalism and
transparency. That is the best way to serve humankind
S/PV.5670
307-32354
and to strengthen the role of the Security Council in the
maintenance of international peace and security.
The President: I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, China, Congo, France, Ghana,
Indonesia, Italy, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1755 (2007).
As there are no speakers inscribed on my list in
explanation of vote following the voting, the Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 12.05 p.m.
