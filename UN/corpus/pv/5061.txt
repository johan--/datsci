The meeting was called to order at 1.15 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2004/756)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus contained in document S/2004/756.
Members also have document S/2004/829, which
contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I met this
morning with the representatives of the parties, who
confirmed to me that maintain their well-known
positions vis-à-vis the item on the Council’s agenda.
On the basis of those meetings, as President and with
the consent of the members of the Council, I draw the
conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision on the draft resolution before it.
If I hear no objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines, Romania,
Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States
of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1568 (2004).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Olsen (United States of America): The
United States voted in favour of this resolution because
it endorses the Secretary-General’s recommendation
for a 30 per cent force-level reduction, as well as his
intention to conduct a further review of the mandate,
force levels and concept of operations of the United
Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP),
continuing to take into account developments on the
ground and the views of the parties prior to the next
UNFICYP renewal. This resolution is an important
first step in the ongoing examination of UNFICYP.
As we have noted, resources for peacekeeping
operations are under strain as the demand for United
Nations peacekeeping has risen significantly in recent
years. Accordingly, we welcome the resolution’s
support for the Secretary-General’s request for further
voluntary contributions to UNFICYP from other
countries and organizations.
We note in addition the Secretary-General’s
assessment that a recurrence of fighting in Cyprus is
increasingly unlikely, with the emphasis of UNFICYP’s
activity moving towards liaison, observation and
mediation rather than the deployment of forces to
prevent the recurrence of fighting and maintain the
status quo.
We also note that the Secretariat team that
conducted the review of UNFICYP sought the views of
the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides about the
situation on the ground and the Secretary-General’s
observation that both sides, as well as the guarantor
Powers, shared the view that under current conditions
UNFICYP should remain in Cyprus beyond 15 December
2004.
My delegation would also like to take this
opportunity to reaffirm our support for the Secretary-
General’s report on his mission of good offices in
Cyprus (S/2004/437). We agree with the report that the
way ahead to a settlement is for the Greek Cypriots to
articulate with clarity and finality the concerns they
have indicated regarding implementation of the settlement
plan and its security provisions. We continue to support
that report’s assessment that Turkey and the Turkish
Cypriots have done everything possible to reach a
Cyprus settlement. We also appreciate Greece’s support
3
S/PV.5061
for the Secretary-General’s effort, including,
specifically, for his final settlement plan.
We reaffirm our support for the Secretary-
General’s recommendation in paragraph 93 of the good
offices mission report that, “not for the purpose of
affording recognition or assisting succession”, the
Security Council should encourage all States to
cooperate both bilaterally and in international bodies to
eliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers that
have the effect of isolating the Turkish Cypriots and
impeding their development. We concur with the
Secretary-General’s assessment that such a move
would be consistent with Security Council resolutions
541 (1983) and 550 (1984).
We regret that to date the Council has not
endorsed the Secretary-General’s report on his mission
of good offices in Cyprus, and we look forward to
Council action in that regard.
I would also note that it is the policy of the
United States Government to ensure that members of
the armed forces of the United States of America
participating in United Nations peace operations are
protected from criminal prosecution or other assertion
of jurisdiction by the International Criminal Court,
including through the possible inclusion of express
provisions providing such protection.
Mr. Akram (Pakistan): Pakistan has voted in
favour of the resolution, and the reasons for our
support are the following. The resolution endorses the
Secretary-General’s recommendations for the
amendment of the concept of operations and force level
of United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP). Secondly, the resolution decides to extend
the mandate of UNFICYP in accordance with the
recommendations of the Secretary-General and the
wishes of all the parties concerned.
However, the resolution did not take stock of
three important elements, which flow from the
radically changed situation on the ground.
First, it fails to respond to the Secretary-
General’s good offices mission report (S/2004/437)
issued in May 2004. That report called on the Council
members to “give a strong lead to all States to
cooperate both bilaterally and in international bodies to
eliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers that
have the effect of isolating the Turkish Cypriots and
impeding their development” (ibid., para. 93).
Secondly, it singles out a single resolution in
operative paragraph 1, which, in view of the
transformed situation on the island, is not necessary.
Thirdly, paragraph 43 of the Secretary-General’s
report (S/2004/756), on amendments in the concept of
operations and the force level of UNFICYP, indicates
that his review team has consulted with all relevant
parties on the island, as well as the guarantor Powers,
on the concept and proposal to extend the mandate of
UNFICYP. That reality was not mentioned in the fourth
preambular paragraph of the resolution.
I wish to reiterate our unreserved support for all
multilateral and bilateral initiatives and endeavours
seeking a final and comprehensive settlement of the
Cyprus problem, a settlement that is based on
consensus, justice and equity.
Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation supported the
adoption of the Security Council resolution extending
the mandate of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP) until 15 June 2004.
That operation continues to play an important
role in maintaining stability and security on the island
of Cyprus. We agreed with the recommendations of the
Secretary-General regarding changes to the concept of
operations and the force level, taking into account the
fact that those changes reflect the situation in security
terms on the island and will not harm the activities of
the United Nations armed forces in carrying out their
mandate.
The Russian Federation continued to help in a
lasting settlement in Cyprus, in accordance with
Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution
1251 (1999) and other decisions of the Security
Council.
We agree on the importance of establishing a
favourable environment for the renewal of the
negotiation process, including through economic
relations between the two Cypriot communities. In that
regard, we must strictly observe the provisions of
Security Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984).
The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of the United
Kingdom.
The United Kingdom welcomes the adoption of
this resolution. The text rightly reflects the changing
4
S/PV.5061
situation on the ground, which is in no small part due
to the work of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP), as well as the offices of the
Secretary-General and his good offices team. We also
recognize the part played by the guarantor Powers and
the parties on the island.
The resolution provides for the implementation of
the Secretary-General’s recommendations for the
downsizing and reconfiguration of UNFICYP and also
provides for a further comprehensive review before the
next mandate. The resolution focuses only on the
narrow issue of the future of UNFICYP. There is, of
course, the wider question of the future of the
settlement process. The Secretary-General has
produced a good report, which the United Kingdom
fully supports.
The Council will need to come back to the
continuing search for a settlement, in the light of
developments. We are disappointed that, having voted
for a settlement in April, Turkish Cypriots have so far
seen little benefit. We remain committed to ending the
isolation of the Turkish Cypriots and to reducing the
economic gap between the two communities. We
believe this to be a key element of keeping alive the
prospect of a reunification.
I now resume my function as President of the
Council.
There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.
