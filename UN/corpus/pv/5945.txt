The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Côte d’Ivoire, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Djédjé
(Côte d’Ivoire) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/486, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, Burkina Faso,
France and South Africa. Members also have before
them document S/2008/451, which contains the
seventeenth progress report of the Secretary-General
on the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
