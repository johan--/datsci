The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia
Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to
Security Council resolution 1846 (2008)
(S/2009/590)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Somalia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Duale
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/206, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the Russian Federation.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1918 (2010).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): I should like to express our gratitude to the
members of the Council for their support of resolution
1918 (2010), which was submitted by the Russian
Federation. We are grateful to our colleagues for the
constructive approach and valuable ideas that made it
possible to give momentum to this important anti-
piracy initiative.
In our view, the resolution adopted today is of
particular importance amid the growing threat posed by
piracy off the coast of Somalia and in more distant
regions of the Indian Ocean. Today, the Security
Council has sent an important political message: that
the international community is determined to combat
impunity and intends to continue seeking additional
mechanisms to enhance the effectiveness of the
prosecution of those who carry out, plan and conduct
acts of piracy.
Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): Uganda voted in favour
of resolution 1918 (2010), on piracy in Somalia and
welcomes its adoption by the Council. Piracy is an
international problem that poses challenges to all
countries. Therefore, combating piracy requires
collective efforts and the contribution of all countries.
Uganda would like to emphasize that a more
effective and comprehensive approach to combating
piracy off the coast of Somalia would be to address its
root causes, especially the instability in mainland
Somalia. That will require greater support for the
Transitional Federal Government and building the
capacity of its institutions so that the Somali people
can take full responsibility for their own country and
their own destiny.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.10 a.m.
