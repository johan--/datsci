The meeting was called to order at 6 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
Report of the Secretary-General on the
African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (S/2011/422)
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/471, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2011/422, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (S/2011/422).
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and United States of
America.
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2003 (2011).
I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
adoption of the resolution.
Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): The presence of the
African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur (UNAMID) in Darfur is crucial, given that its
mandate includes, among other things, contributing to
the facilitation of the Darfur peace process and the
protection of civilians. In that regard, South Africa has
contributed troops and police to UNAMID and will
continue to support the mission. South Africa will
further assist in the search for lasting peace in Darfur
through the African Union (AU) and bilaterally. It was
for that reason that my delegation voted in favour of
resolution 2003 (2011), extending the mandate of
UNAMID for a further 12 months.
This month has seen momentous events in the
history of the Sudan and, indeed, of the entire
continent. A new State, South Sudan, was established,
marking another milestone in the implementation of
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, through which
the people of the Sudan committed themselves to
resolving their decades-long conflict. As we celebrate
this achievement, we remain hopefully that the Doha
document for peace in Darfur will be signed by all
parties to the conflict so that the people of Darfur are
able to build on this positive momentum and move
rapidly towards peace.
Every effort must be employed to ensure that
peace and stability are advanced in Darfur. South
Africa welcomes the conclusion of the Doha peace
process. It is indeed a significant step in building peace
in Darfur.
The African Union, meeting at its highest level in
Malabo recently, endorsed the early launching of the
Darfur political process as a process which provides
‚Äúthe best opportunity to consolidate gains made
so far, ensure ownership by the Sudanese in
resolving their own problems and empower the
various stakeholders, as well as achieve an
inclusive and comprehensive settlement
addressing the interrelated issues of peace, justice
and reconciliation in Darfur‚Äù.
In this regard, South Africa expresses its full and
unequivocal support for the efforts of the AU High-
level Implementation Panel, with the support of
UNAMID, to launch the Darfur political process as
soon as possible.
While acknowledging that the parties should do
everything in their power to create an enabling
environment, we do not view the creation of such an
environment as a precondition to launching the Darfur
political process. To do so would essentially hand a
veto to any potential spoilers to the process. With this
in view, the AU Peace and Security Council appealed
to the Security Council to lend its support to the
launching of the Darfur political process. This was
S/PV.6597
311-43737
done so that this Council could take into consideration
and reflect the AU‚Äôs position in considering the
mandate renewal of UNAMID.
We wish to remind the Council that UNAMID
was created as a hybrid operation in a partnership
between the United Nations and the African Union.
Given this important character and feature of
UNAMID, it is critically important that both
organizations value each others‚Äô contribution to the
success of the mission and to the attainment of
enduring peace and stability in Darfur. We are
therefore disappointed by the timid and qualified
support for the AU‚Äôs request for the commencement of
a Darfur-based political process.
Given the proximity to and sustained involvement
of Africans in resolving the conflict in Darfur, the
international community would do well to heed
Africa‚Äôs call and support the efforts of the African
Union on the Darfur political process. We reiterate the
importance and pre-eminence of Africa‚Äôs leadership in
solving African problems. After all, that is in line with
the provisions of the United Nations Charter as
expressed in its Chapter VIII. Failure to implement the
Darfur peace process in a timely manner would have a
devastating effect by delaying peace further,
condemning the people of Darfur to untold suffering.
South Africa is satisfied with the commendable
efforts deployed by Joint Special Representative
Gambari and the AU High-level Implementation Panel
under the leadership of former President Mbeki, with
the support of stakeholders in the Sudan and the
international community. We are convinced that their
continued efforts will contribute significantly to
bringing peace, stability and reconciliation to the
people of Darfur. The Council should not waiver in its
support to the people of Darfur. We dare not fail them.
Mr. Amieyeofori (Nigeria): Nigeria voted in
favour of resolution 2003 (2011) because we believe in
the indispensable role of the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) in the
efforts to bring lasting peace and stability to Darfur
and overall peace to the Sudan. We remain resolute in
our conviction that the enduring partnership between
the United Nations and the African Union (AU) in
Darfur remains a solid foundation for preserving
international peace and security.
In the spirit of this partnership, we had hoped that
the decision of the seventeenth AU Summit and the
communiqu√© of the AU Peace and Security Council of
19 Judy 2011, stressing that the Darfur political
process should constitute a priority in the new road
map for Darfur and should be fully launched upon the
positive outcome of the Doha process, would have
been given due consideration.
We are convinced that paragraph 7 of the
resolution, specifying complicated enabling conditions
that must be met, will constrain the inauguration of the
Darfur political process. Indeed, making the launching
of the Darfur political process contingent on the
fulfilment of certain preconditions would be
counterproductive. It could equip spoilers with the
means to undermine the search for a comprehensive
peace. It could also undermine the national ownership
of the process.
Nigeria‚Äôs view has consistently been that an
internal political process is vital to inclusiveness and
consensus-building in intercommunal relations in
Darfur. As the Secretary- General notes in his latest
report on UNAMID (S/2011/422), a Darfur peace
process could also benefit from a Darfur-based internal
dialogue and consultations that build popular support
for local ownership and enhance the outcome of the
Doha negotiation in the new road map.
The elements that are enumerated in paragraph 7
are goals and not prerequisites. In our view, if we are
serious about taking the critical first steps towards
creating an enabling environment for the Darfur
political process, then we should call for actions that
are clearly feasible and can be easily implemented.
That would be a more appropriate focus for the
Council and the international community.
We believe that the lifting of the emergency law
in Darfur will greatly enhance the Darfur political
process, as observed by the Joint Special
Representative. It will serve as a critical confidence-
building measure and be sufficient to kick-start the
process.
Finally, we believe that UNAMID has a critical
role to play in ensuring a successful Darfur political
process and in working closely with the Government of
the Sudan to lift the state of emergency. We therefore
discourage efforts to minimize its role or indeed to
exclude UNAMID from the Darfur political process.
Mr. Messone (Gabon) (spoke in French): We are
still following, not without unease, the first steps of the
S/PV.6597
11-437374
State of South Sudan. The issue of peace in Darfur is
one reason for that concern. The pursuit of peace and
security in Darfur remains an ongoing concern of
Gabon.
In that regard, we commend the adoption by the
Peace and Security Council of the African Union on
19 July of a communiqu√© in which it requests the
Security Council to proceed to renew the mandate of
the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur (UNAMID). UNAMID played an essential role
in the Doha negotiations. It also improved its
performance in the area of the protection of civilians.
Resolution 2003 (2011), for which Gabon has just
voted, meets its concern over seeing UNAMID
continue to play a major role in restoring peace and
stability in Darfur. Despite the progress made in the
pursuit of peace in that region of the Sudan, the
security and humanitarian situations in Darfur remain
fragile and threaten the gains of the Doha process.
Therefore, the Malabo African Union summit
called for the launch of the Darfur peace process. We
welcome that decision. We firmly believe that the
Darfur political process, proposed by the African
Union High-Level Implementation Panel, chaired by
President Mbeki, then endorsed by the Malabo summit,
would be the way to strengthen the positive results of
the Doha process. Moreover, those two complementary
processes must ultimately enable the Darfurians
themselves to take true ownership of the restoration of
peace, justice, reconciliation and development in their
region.
In that regard, while acknowledging the need to
create a favourable security, humanitarian and political
environment, Gabon is convinced that the launch and
successful outcome of the Darfur peace process should
not falter over preconditions that threaten to undermine
even the pursuit of peace, justice and reconciliation in
Darfur.
The text that we have just adopted takes up
consensus goals of the Council. Of course, it is still far
from what was called for by the Malebo African Union
summit, but it records the will to commit to the Darfur
peace process.
Mrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): The
United States supports the peacekeepers of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID), who continue to play a critical role in the
safety and security of the people of Darfur.
We are extremely concerned by the situation on
the ground in Darfur. In the light of the dangerous
situation, we are pleased that the Council has
recognized that the enabling environment necessary for
a Darfur-based political process does not yet exist. For
any process to achieve lasting peace in Darfur, the
ability of the participants to express their free will,
without fear of harm or retribution, must be
guaranteed. In Darfur, however, those who speak out
are regularly arrested, tortured or killed.
It is first and foremost the responsibility of the
Government of the Sudan to create such enabling
conditions. We strongly demand that all parties to the
conflict agree to an immediate ceasefire and engage in
direct negotiation.
UNAMID‚Äôs role in bringing peace to Darfur is
critical. The Mission has no higher priority than to
protect civilians and to secure humanitarian access for
millions of vulnerable people. We are pleased that
resolution 2003 (2011) affirms that. Based on reporting
from the field, including UNAMID‚Äôs reporting on
political, civil and human rights, the Security Council,
taking into account the views of the African Union,
will determine whether the enabling conditions
necessary for UNAMID to engage in further efforts
related to the Darfur-based political process have been
met.
As civilians continue to be targeted and bombs
continue to be dropped in Darfur, the United States
welcomes UNAMID‚Äôs focus on protecting civilians and
ensuring that humanitarians have the access that they
need to provide lifesaving assistance. We call on the
parties to the conflict to recommit themselves to
serious and comprehensive political negotiations to
bring an end to such atrocities.
Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour of
resolution 2003 (2011). We believe that the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID) plays an important stabilizing role in that
region of the Sudan. The Russian Federation views
UNAMID as an integral component of a Darfur
settlement.
Significantly, the Mission‚Äôs mandate includes a
broad set of political support tasks pertaining to the
S/PV.6597
511-43737
peace process and to the mediation efforts of the
African Union and the United Nations. These include
support for and monitoring of the implementation of
the Darfur peace agreements, and assistance in the
preparation and conduct of inter-Darfurian dialogue
and consultations.
On 14 July, the Government of the Sudan and the
Justice and Equality Movement signed the Doha
document for peace in Darfur, which we see as a very
important step towards a Darfur settlement. In chapter
7 of that document, the parties agreed to engage in
inter-Darfurian dialogue and stipulated that it should be
undertaken with the assistance of UNAMID, the
African Union and the Government of Qatar. The
political process is designed to build a broad platform
of civil society in Darfur for the implementation of the
agreements.
The need to launch the Darfur political process is
recognized in a resolution adopted by the African
Union Peace and Security Council on 19 July. Russia
fully supports that position. We believe that inter-
Darfurian dialogue is a core element of the new road
map for a peaceful settlement in Darfur, as called for in
resolution 2003 (2011).
We highly value UNAMID‚Äôs activities and the
efforts of its head, Joint Special Representative
Gambari, to promote a settlement in Darfur. We believe
that, in the difficult conditions prevailing in Darfur, the
peacekeepers are doing their utmost to undertake the
tasks assigned to them by the Security Council. We call
on all parties in Darfur to support UNAMID‚Äôs
activities.
Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation welcomes resolution 2003 (2011),
just adopted by the Council. China voted in favour of
the resolution.
China has consistently supported the peace
process in Darfur, the Sudan, and we hope for an early
attainment of peace, prosperity and development in
Darfur. China maintains that the issue of Darfur should
be addressed through the dual-track strategy, with
equal emphasis on peacekeeping deployment and the
political process. We support the renewal of the
mandate of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) in order to continue to
implement the Security Council mandate.
The African Union (AU) is an important partner
of the United Nations in addressing questions related to
the Sudan. The AU‚Äôs position on the Darfur political
process merits close attention. China supports
UNAMID playing an important role in supporting the
political process in Darfur.
Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): In
supporting resolution 2003 (2011), extending the
mandate of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) for 12 months, the
United Kingdom is conscious that Darfur is entering a
critical period in which its people need the support of
both the United Nations and the African Union more
than ever.
We therefore welcome the essential work that
UNAMID is doing to protect civilians and to provide
security for humanitarian access in Darfur. Given the
deterioration in the security situation and its impact on
civilians, we encourage the Mission to maintain and
enhance its robust approach to the delivery of these
core tasks.
We also recognize the vital importance of
working towards a comprehensive peace for Darfur.
We welcome the signature on 14 July by the
Government of the Sudan and the Liberation and
Justice Movement of the agreement on the adoption of
the Doha document for peace in Darfur. We urge the
Government of the Sudan and all the armed movements
to engage immediately and without preconditions to
make every effort to reach a permanent ceasefire and a
comprehensive peace settlement on the basis of the
Doha document.
Further, we recognize the potential
complementary role of a Darfur-based political process
in engaging all Darfur stakeholders in constructive and
open dialogue. However, we note that the elements of
the necessary enabling environment for such a Darfur
process, as identified by the United Nations Security
Council and the African Union Peace and Security
Council in their joint communiqu√© of 21 May, are not
yet in place. We note that the Secretary-General made
clear in his report (S/2011/422) that this enabling
environment was paramount.
As resolution 2003 (2011) makes clear, the
Secretary-General and the Security Council will
monitor developments very closely so that the proper
assessments can be made and so that the Security
Council can take the necessary decisions regarding the
S/PV.6597
11-437376
Darfur political process and UNAMID‚Äôs participation
in it.
We thank Joint Special Representative Ibrahim
Gambari and the personnel of UNAMID for their work
in support of peace and security in Darfur.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council will remain seized of
the matter.
The meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.
