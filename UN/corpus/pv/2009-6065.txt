The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Members of the Council that I have
received letters from the representatives of Djibouti
and Eritrea, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Olhaye

the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

12 January 2009 from the Permanent Representative of

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
