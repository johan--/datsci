The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia
The President (spoke in Spanish): Under rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representatives of Italy, Somalia, Spain and
Ukraine to participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/228, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Colombia, Denmark,
France, Gabon, India, Italy, Lebanon, Nigeria,
Portugal, the Russian Federation, Spain and Ukraine.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall now put the draft resolution to the vote.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1976 (2011).
I now give the floor to the representative of the
Russian Federation, who wishes to speak following the
adoption of the resolution.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The worsening piracy off the coast of
Somalia requires that the international community
adopt qualitatively new measures to combat it. Today,
we have taken a great step forward in combating
piracy. The resolution adopted on our initiative
includes a broad array of qualitatively new measures
aimed at establishing the necessary conditions to more
effectively counteract pirates. It generally draws on the
ideas of Mr. Jack Lang, Special Adviser to the
Secretary-General on Legal Issues Related to Piracy
off the Coast of Somalia, which enjoy broad
international support, and takes in an entire set of
problems related to the growing piracy threat.
For the Russian Federation, it is important that
the resolution includes special emphasis on combating
impunity for pirates. The request on the Secretary-
General to report to the Council on practical aspects
for establishing national anti-piracy courts in Somalia
and a specialized Somali anti-piracy court with
international components on the territory of a third
State is a first practical step towards establishing an
effective judicial mechanism capable of providing a
credible and reliable solution to the problem of
bringing pirates to justice. We look forward to
receiving a thorough report from the Secretary-General
that includes concrete proposals on the modalities for
establishing such anti-piracy courts. For our part, we
are prepared to provide the Secretary-General with all
the necessary support to carry out that work.
Allow me to express our appreciation to all the
members of the Council for their cooperation, support
and determination to achieve compromise. We are also
grateful to our colleagues for their valuable ideas,
which made it possible for us to strengthen the
resolution and to lend momentum to this important
anti-piracy initiative.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
