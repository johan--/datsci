The question concerning Haiti

The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru,
Spain and Uruguay, in which they request to be invited
to participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mérorès
(Haiti) took a seat at the Council table; the
representatives of the other aforementioned
countries took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council Chamber.
The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security

its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

draft resolution submitted by Argentina, Belgium,

Peru, Spain, the United States of America and Uruguay.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2008/586, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless
I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.
