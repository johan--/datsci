The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus, document S/2001/1122.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2001/1190, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
I should also like to draw the attention of the
members of the Council to document S/2001/1162,
which contains the text of a letter dated 10 December
2001 from the Secretary-General.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2001/1190) before it.
I should like to inform the Security Council that,
in my capacity as President of the Council, I have met
with the representatives of the parties, who have
confirmed to me that they maintain their well known
positions vis-à-vis the item on the Council’s agenda.
On the basis of those meetings, as President, with the
consent of the members of the Council, I have drawn
the conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision on the draft resolution before it.
If I hear no objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bangladesh, China, Colombia, France, Ireland,
Jamaica, Mali, Mauritius, Norway, Russian
Federation, Singapore, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1384 (2001).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
