The meeting was called to order at 4.05 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Non-proliferation
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Germany, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Hanz
(Germany) took the seat reserved for him at the
side of the Council Chamber.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/624, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, China, Croatia,
France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.
It is my understand that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall now give the floor to members of the
Council wishing to make statements before the voting.
Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): Indonesia’s
principled position with regard to the issue before the
Council remains. First, it is imperative to find a
peaceful solution to any question related to nuclear
non-proliferation.
Secondly, any solution must be guided by the
need to protect the integrity of multilateral
arrangements, in particular the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is
fundamentally based upon three main pillars, namely
non-proliferation, the peaceful uses of nuclear energy
and nuclear disarmament.
Thirdly, Indonesia has full confidence in the
credibility, independence and efficiency of the
International Atomic Energy Agency as the sole
competent authority for the verification of the
respective safeguard obligations of Member States.
The present draft resolution does not provide for
additional sanctions against Iran. If it did, we would
not have been able to support it. The draft resolution
reaffirms previous statements and resolutions and calls
on Iran to comply fully with its obligations under those
resolutions.
However, it would not have sufficed to stop there.
As a matter of principle, Indonesia attaches the greatest
weight to a negotiated solution of the issue. It is our
firm belief that negotiations and dialogue offer the best
chance for a solution. My delegation therefore
appreciates the incorporation of its amendment
reaffirming the commitment to a negotiated solution of
the issue as part of the dual-track approach. Such a
dual-track approach must have the same common
objectives and must not cancel one another out. An
atmosphere conducive to the negotiations must be
nurtured and promoted.
Indonesia shall work earnestly to ensure that the
Council’s resolutions add value and do not lessen it,
and that they provide incentives, and not disincentives,
to negotiations. From our perspective, the draft
resolution before us is, above all, a reaffirmation of the
intrinsic promise of negotiation as a means to find
solutions.
For those considerations and reasons, Indonesia
will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us
today.
The President (spoke in French): The Council
will now proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2008/624) before it.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South

The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1835 (2008).
There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 4.15 p.m.
