S/PV.7338 The situation in Afghanistan 12/12/2014
The meeting was called to order at 11.40 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Afghanistan
The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representative of Afghanistan to
participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2014/893, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Australia.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Australia, Chad, Chile, China, France,
Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Nigeria, Republic
of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and United States of America
The President (spoke in French): The draft
resolution received 15 votes in favour. The draft
resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution
2189 (2014).
I now give the floor to the representative of
Afghanistan.
Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan): At the outset, I would like
to thank the Republic of Chad for its leadership of the
Security Council during this month. I would also like to
thank Council members for the adoption of resolution
2189 (2014), which is of vital importance to ongoing
stabilization efforts and to the future of Afghanistan.
I also thank Ambassador Quinlan and his team at the
Permanent Mission of Australia for their hard work and
able facilitation of the resolution, as well as for their
dedication as the penholder on Afghanistan.
This resolution has been adopted as the mission
of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)
ends and a new phase in Afghanistan’s history begins.
In just 19 days, Afghan National Defense and Security
Forces (ANDSF) will assume full responsibility for
the security of the country as the transition process
comes to a close on December 31. The adoption of this
resolution is a clear indication of the continuing support
of the Council and the international community for the
efforts of the Afghan people and the Government of
Afghanistan to bring peace, stability, democracy and
prosperity to the country throughout the transformation
decade.
At this crucial juncture in our history, this resolution
signifies the necessity of enduring and long-term
support for Afghanistan. As the transformation decade
begins, we are grateful to our NATO and international
partners for their commitment to train, advise and assist
the ANDSF after the completion of the ISAF mission.
No doubt, there are challenges ahead. Al-Qaida and the
Taliban continue to launch brutal terror attacks. Just
yesterday, a suicide bomber attacked a French school in
Kabul, killing civilians and injuring 15. A few weeks
ago, a suicide bomber attacked a crowd watching a
volleyball match in Paktika province, killing over
50 people and wounding more than 60 others. Those
are but a few examples of a series of horrific attacks on
civilians in Kabul and around the country.
In the face of those challenges, the new President
and the national unity Government of Afghanistan look
forward to strengthening cooperation with our NATO,
regional and international partners. We understand
that peace and stability cannot be achieved through
security measures alone. To that end, the Government
of Afghanistan is embarking upon an ambitious reform
agenda aimed at bringing peace and prosperity to the
country.
I would like to take this opportunity to express the
Government of Afghanistan’s profound gratitude to the
NATO and partner countries and their international
forces, who have sacrificed their blood and treasure to
support Afghanistan in its fight to advance peace and
security in the country. With the ongoing support of our
international partners, including through the Resolute
Support Mission, and the vigorous work of the new
Government of Afghanistan, their efforts will not have
been in vain.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.45 a.m
