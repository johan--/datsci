The meeting was called to order at 1.15 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/417, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): Mr. President, you were about to put to the
vote a text before us in document S/2011/417. As far as
I understand from the consultations, the adoption of the
draft resolution, with the inclusion of the date of
10 July, with the resulting retroactive effect on the
Mission, is not in line with the Council‚Äôs normal
practice. You will recall, Sir, that our staff worked on
the text. Could you explain the issue of the date? We
are adopting on 11 July a document with retroactive
effect to yesterday. It was drafted to take effect 10 July,
so we have a situation in which we are adopting a
document with retrospective effect. That is not in line
with normal practice in the Council.
The President: As far as I know, this issue was
discussed by the political coordinators on the
understanding that, concerning the date in the draft
resolution, the language of paragraph 1 ‚Äî ‚Äúdecides to
withdraw UNMIS effective 10 July 2011‚Äù ‚Äî would be
replaced with ‚Äúdecides to withdraw UNMIS‚Äù. I hope
that this will respond to the points raised by the
representative of the Russian Federation. I take it that
this is the case and we can now proceed to the vote on
the draft resolution before us.
Ms. Rice (United States of America): We need to
understand what we are voting on. Forgive me for
interrupting. How would paragraph 1 be changed in
this context ‚Äî to put a period after UNMIS?
The President: That is correct. Once again, let
me underline that this matter was apparently discussed
beforehand by our political coordinators.
Ms. Rice (United States of America): I
understand, but why would we not make it ‚Äúeffective
today‚Äù? Why have no date? What was the logic?
The President: I have no explanation as to why
the political coordinators have not come up with that
idea. But we can change the language ad hoc, right
now, if I hear no objection. I think this is not a
theological issue; it is a factual issue, and I take it that
our colleagues around the table can live with that
suggestion by our colleague from the United States.
Ms. Rice (United States of America): It just does
not seem to make sense. It could be ‚Äúwithdraw in 6
months time‚Äù, if you do not put a date on it.
The President: I think everyone is in agreement
with that suggestion, so we will put today‚Äôs date,
11 July.
It is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America
The President: The draft resolution received 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1997 (2011).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Ms. Rice (United States of America): The United
States deeply regrets the necessity to vote on this
resolution to end the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS). We call on the
Government of the Sudan yet again to reconsider its
demand that UNMIS cease its activities in the Republic
of the Sudan effective 9 July. The Mission has a critical
role to continue to play in regional stability, especially
in the two areas.
The United States is sending a clear message,
along with other Council members, that it wants the
United Nations to remain in the two areas, especially at
this critical juncture. With this resolution, the Council
has made clear that it is ready to authorize continued
United Nations operations in Southern Kordofan and
S/PV.6579
311-40867
Blue Nile to support new security arrangements, and
we will continue over the coming weeks to urge the
Government of the Sudan to accept this. It is in its
interest to do so. We hope that others in the
international community will continue to encourage
Khartoum to accept this. It is critical that the
Government of the Sudan cooperate fully with UNMIS
as it begins the process of withdrawing.
We continue to be deeply concerned about the
fighting in Southern Kordofan, the displacement of
civilians and the ensuing humanitarian crisis. The
Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People‚Äôs
Liberation Movement North must return to the
negotiating table in the coming days and agree to an
immediate cessation of hostilities. We also call on the
Government of the Sudan to work actively on
agreements to bring peace and stability to the border
and in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan states.
Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): It is
with regret that we have today supported the adoption
of resolution 1997 (2011) on the withdrawal of the
United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS).
Since its inception in support of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) of 2005,
UNMIS has worked to support the parties in fulfilling
their commitments under the Agreement and, where
conflict has occurred, and has acted to protect civilians
and ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance to
those in need. We thank UNMIS and Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Haile
Menkerios for their tireless efforts in this regard.
Sadly, the UNMIS presence is still needed in
Southern Kordofan state, where we continue to be
deeply concerned by reports of ongoing violations of
human rights and international humanitarian law.
Civilians continue to suffer the impact of conflict,
including aerial bombardment by the Sudanese Armed
Forces and other abuses, reportedly including
extrajudicial killings, forced displacement and arbitrary
arrests and detentions. We unreservedly condemn the
ongoing violence.
In the absence of agreement on an extension, we
call on the Sudanese authorities to cooperate with
UNMIS in accordance with the status-of-forces
agreement and the provisions of resolution 1997 (2011)
as it winds down its operations, and to allow and
support unfettered humanitarian access by
humanitarian personnel to populations in need. We
further call on the Government of the Sudan and the
Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Movement North to end
hostilities and agree a ceasefire leading to new security
arrangements.
We reiterate the readiness of this Council, as set
out in the resolution that we have just adopted, both to
continue current United Nations operations in Southern
Kordofan and Blue Nile states and to assist the parties
in implementation of new arrangements to be agreed
between them. We recall the importance of completing
the CPA-mandated popular consultations processes, by
which the people of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile
will express their views as to their future governance.
Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): France is
grateful to the United Nations Mission in the Sudan
(UNMIS), under the leadership of Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Menkerios, for
the outstanding work it has carried out since its
establishment, despite difficult working conditions, in
protecting civilians and ensuring follow-up to the
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement of 2005, which led to independence for
South Sudan, celebrated this past Saturday.
France supported the adoption of resolution 1997
(2011) on the withdrawal of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan. However, we regret that this
comes at a time when a ceasefire has yet to be signed
for Southern Kordofan. The civilian population
continues to suffer in the fighting, and humanitarian
access has not been re-established. Blue Nile state also
remains a source of concern for us.
We therefore call on the Government of the
Sudan to consider an international presence in these
two states. We urge the Government of the Sudan and
the Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Movement North to
cease their hostilities immediately, sign a ceasefire
agreement and conclude security arrangements in
Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states. We reiterate
the Security Council‚Äôs readiness to support the parties
in expediting the implementation of such
arrangements.
The President: I shall now make a statement in
my national capacity.
Germany welcomes the unanimous adoption of
the resolution on the drawdown of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS). The Council thereby
confirms the end of the mandate for UNMIS in the
S/PV.6579
11-408674
Sudan and reiterates the existing legal framework, as
agreed to between the Government of the Sudan and
the United Nations, for the liquidation of the Mission.
We call on the relevant authorities in the Sudan to
fully respect the provisions of the status-of-forces
agreement of December 2005 and to ensure that all
steps are being taken for an orderly and smooth
withdrawal of all UNMIS forces.
We agree with the previous speakers that there is
a need for a United Nations presence in the north,
especially the border areas. We are deeply concerned
about the ongoing violence, especially in Southern
Kordofan. We call on the Government of the Sudan and
the Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Movement North to
immediately cease all hostilities and stop attacks on the
civilian population. We especially condemn all
airstrikes against villages in Southern Kordofan.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.
There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.
