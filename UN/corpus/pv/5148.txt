Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Afghanistan
Report of the Secretary-General on the

The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Afghanistan, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Farhâdi
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/183, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the situation in Afghanistan and
its implications for international peace and security.
Members also have before them document S/2005/195,
which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in
the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,

of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United

The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
