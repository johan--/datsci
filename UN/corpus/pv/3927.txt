Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:
“The Security Council welcomes the report of
the Secretary-General of 13 April 1998 on The
causes of conflict and the promotion of durable
peace and sustainable development in Africa', which
was submitted to the Security Council (S/1998/318)
and the General Assembly (A/52/871). It agrees with
the Secretary-General that the credibility of the
United Nations in Africa to a great extent depends
upon the willingness of the international community
to act and to explore new means of advancing the
objectives of peace and security in the African
continent.
“The Security Council, which has the primary
responsibility under the Charter of the United
Nations for international peace and security,
expresses its commitment to exercising this
responsibility in relation to Africa, and affirms that
strengthening Africa’s capacity to participate in all
aspects of peacekeeping operations, including their
military, police, humanitarian and other civilian
components, is a key priority.
“The Security Council encourages increased
bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the field of
peacekeeping, especially capacity-building, between
Member States, the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) as well as
subregional organizations in Africa. It welcomes the
efforts already undertaken by the United Nations and
Member States to promote greater transparency and
coordination in multilateral efforts to enhance
Africa’s capacity for peacekeeping. In particular, it
welcomes efforts to implement the recommendations
in the report of the Secretary-General of 1
November 1995 on Improving preparedness for
conflict prevention and peacekeeping in Africa'
(S/1995/911) and to follow up the outcome of the
meetings organized by the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations in December 1997 and
May 1998. It encourages all States and organizations
concerned to work with African States in particular
on the basis of African initiatives and proposals.
“The Security Council encourages
contributions, financial and in kind, aimed at
enhancing Africa’s peacekeeping capacity. In
particular, it urges Member States to contribute to
2
Security Council 3927th meeting
Fifty-third year 16 September 1998
the trust funds established by the United Nations and
the OAU to improve preparedness for conflict
prevention and peacekeeping in Africa.
“The Security Council affirms the role of the
United Nations in setting general standards for
peacekeeping, and urges compliance with existing
United Nations guidelines, including through the use
of the Ten Rules Code of Personal Conduct for Blue
Helmets, which were elaborated following a request
by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations
(A/51/230). It encourages all those involved in
enhancing Africa’s peacekeeping capacity to ensure
that training for and the conduct of peacekeeping give
due emphasis to international humanitarian law and
human rights, including the rights of the child, as well
as to gender issues. It requests all those conducting
peacekeeping operations in Africa to pay particular
attention to the situation of children in armed conflict,
as appropriate, both in mandates for and reports about
such operations.
“The Security Council supports the efforts of the
United Nations, regional and subregional organizations
as well as Member States in the field of training for
peacekeeping.
“The Security Council welcomes the readiness of
the United Nations to act as a clearing house for
information on available training initiatives. It
particularly welcomes the intention of the
Secretary-General to establish a United Nations
database on training. With the aim of strengthening
Africa’s peacekeeping capacity, the Security Council
requests the Secretary-General to pursue these plans,
and to include in the database information about
African needs in this field, possible regional and
extraregional contributions to assist in achieving this
goal, and available expertise on training. It encourages
Member States and regional and subregional
organizations to contribute information to the database.
It encourages the Secretary-General to consider
possible further uses and broadening of United
Nations databases, for instance in humanitarian crises.
“The Security Council also welcomes the
proposal of the Secretary-General to establish an
informal working group composed of African and
non-African States directly involved or interested in
the provision of training assistance.
“The Security Council emphasizes the value of
training aimed at improving coordination and
cooperation among military, police, humanitarian
and other civilian components of peacekeeping
operations. It encourages the Secretary-General and
Member States to engage international and
non-governmental humanitarian organizations, as
appropriate,in peacekeeping training activities.
“The Security Council underlines the
importance of the availability of appropriately
trained personnel and relevant equipment for all
components of peacekeeping operations. In this
context, it encourages increased participation by
Member States, in particular from Africa, in the
United Nations standby arrangements. The Council
further encourages the use of United Nations
Training Assistance Teams as a useful tool in
support of national peacekeeping training. It
recognizes the value of joint training exercises, as
well as the establishment of partnerships between
States whose contingents require equipment and
States and organizations that are able to assist them.
It also encourages the exchange of lessons learned
from previous operations.
“The Security Council requests the
Secretary-General to study ways to improve the
availability of logistics for peacekeeping efforts in
Africa.
“The Security Council stresses the need for it
to be fully informed of peacekeeping activities
carried out or planned by regional or subregional
organizations and underlines that the improved flow
of information and the holding of regular briefing
meetings between members of the Council, African
regional and subregional organizations involved in
peacekeeping operations and troop contributors and
other participating Member States have an important
role to play in helping enhance African
peacekeeping capacity. In that context, the Council
encourages the Secretary-General to establish
appropriate United Nations liaison with regional and
subregional organizations and invites those
organizations and Member States to provide the
Security Council and the Secretary-General with
information on their activities in the field of
peacekeeping.”
