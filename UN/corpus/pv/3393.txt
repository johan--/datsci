The agenda was adopted.
The question of South Africa
Report of the Secretary-General on the question of
South Africa (S/1994/717)
The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
South Africa in which he requests to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council’s
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative
to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Steward (South
Africa) took a place at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the question of South Africa,
document S/1994/717. Members of the Council also have
before them document S/1994/752, which contains the text
of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/1994/627, which contains the
text of a letter dated 26 May 1994 from the Chargé
d’affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of Greece
to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/1994/752) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Djibouti,
France, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Rwanda, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 930 (1994).
The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item "The question of South Africa",
which, in accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution
930 (1994), is removed from the list of matters of which
the Council is seized.
The meeting rose at 11.10 a.m.
