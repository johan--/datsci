The meeting was called to order at 11.25 a.m.
Expression of thanks to the retiring President
The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of December 2008, I
should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on
behalf of the Council, to His Excellency Mr. Jorge
Urbina, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica to the
United Nations, for his service as President of the
Security Council for the month of November 2008. I
am sure I speak for all members of the Security
Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador
Urbina to the great diplomatic skill with which he
conducted the Council’s business last month.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Greece,
Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Somalia, Spain and
Ukraine, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Duale
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table; the
representatives of the other aforementioned
countries took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council Chamber.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/748, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy,
Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Spain, Ukraine, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.
Members of the Council also have before them
the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in
Somalia, document S/2008/709.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America,
Viet Nam
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1846 (2008).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Zhang Yesui (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China voted in favour of the resolution just adopted on
piracy off the Somali coast. I wish to take this
opportunity to make a few points.
Piracy off the coast of Somalia is running
rampant and poses a direct threat to international
humanitarian assistance and the security of
international navigation. It also poses a potential threat
to the world economy. In the long run, it will harm
Somalia and its people as well.
The international community needs to work
together to solve the problem. The Security Council
bears primary responsibility for the maintenance of
international peace and security and is therefore
duty-bound to play a leading role on this issue.
That is why this year the Security Council
adopted resolutions 1816 (2008) and 1838 (2008) in
close succession, authorizing national warships to enter
the waters off the Somali coast to fight piracy. The
S/PV.6026
308-62880
resolution just adopted lays the foundation for the
establishment of a platform for international judicial
cooperation in the fight against piracy.
Combating piracy is a new challenge facing the
international community. As it has an impact on the
fundamental interests of Member States, it is obvious
that the United Nations should play a leadership and
coordinating role.
As a victim of piracy off the coast of Somalia,
China vigorously supports and is ready to participate in
the international anti-piracy endeavours coordinated by
the United Nations. Nevertheless, China believes that
the piracy issue is only a symptom of Somalia’s
deep-seated political and social crisis. The issue cannot
be fundamentally resolved if the domestic crisis in
Somalia is not effectively addressed. While focusing
on piracy, the international community should not lose
sight of the root causes of the worsening piracy issue.
Only by starting the Somali reconciliation process will
it be possible to resolve the disputes among various
factions in the country, encourage the Somali people to
form a national consensus, promote economic
development and ensure that the people are content and
live in happiness. Otherwise, the security situation in
Somalia will not stabilize and there will not be a
lasting solution to the Somali issue, which has plagued
the international community for nearly 20 years.
The worsening humanitarian crisis in Somalia has
already evolved into one of the most serious
humanitarian crises in Africa.
China appreciates the important role played by
the African Union Mission in Somalia in addressing the
security situation in Somalia and calls on the
international community to provide real support to the
Mission. China has provided its assistance to the
African Union for its peacekeeping operations in
Somalia and will continue to give positive
consideration to similar requests for assistance in the
future.
China maintains that the United Nations should
be more actively engaged in the Somali issue. We call
upon the Security Council to heed the strong appeal of
the Somali Government and the African Union and
support the early deployment of United Nations
peacekeeping troops in Somalia to take over the
African Union peacekeeping mission there. We also
urge the various factions in Somalia to create
favourable political conditions in the country for the
early deployment of the United Nations peacekeeping
forces.
We are convinced that the Somali people long for
peace and that the various factions in the country will
one day overcome their political disputes, conform to
the aspirations of the people and reach political
arrangements that will put Somalia back on the track
towards peace and stabilization. The international
community should also be fully confident in this and
work with the Somali people towards this goal.
Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): My delegation
voted in favour of resolution 1846 (2008) on the basis
of a number of considerations, and we would like to
put them on record.
The security situation off the coast of Somalia
has deteriorated markedly due to acts of piracy and
armed robbery at sea. These acts have become more
blatant and impose greater costs on the international
community, in particular the transportation of
humanitarian assistance into Somalia and the security
of international navigation in the area. They have also
had an adverse impact on the social and economic lives
of the affected countries. We condemn and deplore all
acts of piracy and armed robbery against vessels in the
waters off the coast of Somalia. We would also like to
extend our strong support to the flag States and others
who have already fallen prey to such illegal acts.
We fully support concerted measures to assist
Somalia in fighting such acts. Let there be no doubt of
the importance of enhancing cooperation and, not least,
coordination among States in curbing such acts.
Resolution 1816 (2008) and subsequent resolutions,
including the one that we have just adopted, provides a
strong legal foundation for States to meet this
objective.
We remain convinced, however, that the root
cause of the piracy threat is the situation in Somalia
itself, which is due to political conflict, lawlessness
and lack of capacity for law enforcement. While the
international community needs to address the scourge
of piracy off the coast of Somalia, it is ultimately on
the ground that the international community needs to
translate its words into deeds. This includes greater
support for the African Union Mission to Somalia
(AMISOM) and the political process in the short term,
and the mustering of international military resources in
the medium to long term.
Finally, our support for the resolution is based on
the fact that it seeks to help Somalia, is focused on
Somalia and spells out clearly that its provisions shall
not affect the rights, obligations or responsibilities of
Member States under international law, including under
S/PV.6026
08-628804
the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea and shall not be considered as establishing
customary international law.
Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation is extremely
concerned about the increasing number of incidents of
piracy and robbery at sea in the area of Somalia and the
seas around it. We cannot ignore the fact that the
pirates are making use of increasingly sophisticated
methods in their criminal activity and that their goals
are ever-expanding.
Given the extent of these crimes against ships in
the Gulf of Aden, the Russian navy has become
actively involved in combating piracy in the region. At
the present time, the Russian ship Neustrashimy is
right now engaged in operational observation off the
coast of Somalia in collaboration with naval vessels of
other States cooperating with the Government of
Somalia. We have already rebuffed several pirate
attacks. We are studying the possibility of sending
additional forces of the Russian navy to the region.
The resolution adopted today contains a number
of new and important elements. In particular, measures
to combat pirates off the coast of Somalia are now
clearly included in the context of joint efforts to
re-establish peace and law and order in that country.
The resolution welcomes the initiatives of States,
includes the Russian Federation, and of international
organizations to curb this scourge. An important role
must be played by the measures outlined in the
resolution to strengthen the ability of marine shippers,
in cooperation with the International Maritime
Organization, to use their own potential to ward off
pirate attacks.
We are convinced that, for an effective
implementation of the anti-piracy measures approved
by the Security Council, there is a need for agreed and
properly coordinated action by States. Here, the
resolution also represents a step forward, since it is
aimed at the study of ways to improve the coordinating
role of the United Nations. Enhanced attention must
also be paid to such complex issues as those connected
with the detention of individuals involved in piracy and
robbery on the seas and the appropriate jurisdiction for
bringing such individuals to justice. We believe that
this will promote the implementation by States of the
mechanisms provided for in the Convention for the
Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of
Maritime Navigation of 1988, as provided for by the
resolution.
Once again, I would like to note that, in
discussing the problem of piracy off the shores of
Somalia, we all understand, of course, that a long-term
solution to this problem will only be found through a
comprehensive political settlement in this country, with
the cooperation of the United Nations and the African
Union.
Mr. Mantovani (Italy): I would like to
congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the
presidency of the Security Council and to express our
warmest appreciation to Ambassador Urbina of Costa
Rica and his team for the excellent work done during
their presidency last month.
I would like to join other members in welcoming
today’s adoption of resolution 1846 (2008), which
renews and improves resolution 1816 (2008) and
makes our collective fight against piracy off the coast
of Somalia even stronger and more coordinated and
effective.
The resolution provides the necessary legal basis
for the adoption of Operation Atalanta by the European
Union, which is expected to begin shortly. It also
provides clear indications and guidelines for Member
States and organizations already operating in the area
with their units, such as NATO.
As in past occasions, I wish to underline once
again that piracy off the coast of Somalia is a
consequence of the political, security and humanitarian
crisis that has been taking place in Somalia for many
years. In order to eliminate piracy, we have a
responsibility to bring peace and stability to that
country. We now see an opportunity for that. We hope
that the meeting to be held in mid-December with the
participation of several ministers can provide an
opportunity to shift gears with regard to Somalia and to
support current efforts at peace resolutely and
effectively. We owe that to the civilian population of
Somalia, which has suffered so much during more than
15 years of war and which is looking to the United
Nations with great hope and confidence.
The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council will remain seized of
the matter.
The meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.
