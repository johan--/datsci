Agenda
The situation in Somalia
Letter dated 19 April 2013 from the Secretary-General addressed to the
President of the Security Council (S/2013/239)

Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda,
Togo, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 2102 (2013).
I now give the floor to the representative of Somalia.
Mr. Duale (Somalia): I fully appreciate the fact that
the Council has invited me to be present here today and
to witness the adoption of this new and very important
resolution 2102 (2013), which, I believe, provides real
support for my new Government and facilitates the
achievement of its policy of developing Somalia in the
areas of, inter alia, governance and security.
Mr. President, allow me also to thank your
predecessor as well as the incoming Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Nicholas
Kay, and to express my appreciation and thanks to
Mr. Mahiga, the outgoing Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, for a job well done.
I believe that the resolution just adopted ensures that
the first steps of the process of support by the United
Nations and the Security Council in particular will be
truly effective, especially with the proposed United
Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM),
which ensures that Somalia and the Government of
Somalia will now have only one door for dialogue and
for support.
We appreciate the Secretary-General’s letter
and report (S/2013/239), which ushered in this very
important resolution, which we fully endorse. My
Government has already expressed its appreciation for
the Secretary-General’s letter and report.
We are also confident that the Security Council,
the international community and all other partners
in the development of Somalia’s future will abide by
what is clearly expressed here — that the sovereignty
of Somalia and the ownership of every action belong to
the Federal Government of Somalia, while at the same
time the regional authorities must also be consulted.
We welcome the emphasis on coordination and urgent
action, and we hope in particular that the conference
to be held in London on 7 May will enable us to garner
some resources, both human and financial, so that the
Government of Somalia can implement its mandates,
in cooperation and coordination with UNSOM and our
international partners.
The meeting was called to order at 11.35 a.m.
Expression of thanks to the outgoing President
The President (spoke in French): I should like
to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of
the Council, to His Excellency Mr. Eugène-Richard
Gasana, Permanent Representative of the Republic of
Rwanda, for his service as President of the Security
Council for the month of April 2013. I am sure that
I speak for all members of the Council in expressing
deep appreciation to Ambassador Gasana and his team
for the great diplomatic skill with which they conducted
the Council’s business last month.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia
Letter dated 19 April 2013 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the
President of the Security Council (S/2013/239)
The President (spoke in French): Under rule 37 of
the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Somalia to participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2013/259, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Australia, France, Luxembourg, the
Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Togo, the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United
States of America.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2013/239, which contains a letter dated
19 April 2013 from the Secretary-General addressed to
the President of the Security Council, transmitting the
results of the Secretary-General’s technical assessment
mission to Somalia, pursuant to Security Council
resolution 2093 (2013).
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, China, France,
Guatemala, Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan,

S/PV.6959
That said, I hope that we will soon see, within the
year we have been granted by the Security Council
in which to report back, that this year will bring the
opening of opportunities for Somalia’s development.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.
