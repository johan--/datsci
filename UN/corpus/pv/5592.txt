The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Côte d’Ivoire, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate
in the consideration of the item, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/2006/964, which
contains a letter dated 8 December 2006 from the
Chairman of the Committee established pursuant to

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2006/982) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I
