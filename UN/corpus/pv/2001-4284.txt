The meeting was called to order at 11.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation concerning Western Sahara
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation concerning Western Sahara
(S/2001/148)
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the situation
concerning Western Sahara, document S/2001/148.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2001/165, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/2001/155, which contains
the text of a letter dated 21 February 2001 from
Algeria.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2001/165) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall
now put the draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bangladesh, China, Colombia, France, Ireland,
Jamaica, Mali, Mauritius, Norway, Russian
Federation, Singapore, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America.
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1342 (2001).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
(spoke in French)
Since this is the last public meeting of the month,
I wish to extend to all the members of the Security
Council and to all delegations our sincerest thanks for
their efforts in assisting the Tunisian presidency of the
Council at all stages of the implementation of the
programme we proposed for this month. It is a rather
short month, but one that has been filled every day by
important issues and during which we have held
consultations and discussions and taken decisions of
great interest and significance.
Together with my colleagues here and thanks to
their help and cooperation, we have had an overview of
the important issues under discussion. We have had the
good fortune and honour of meeting with many
decision-makers, from whom we have obtained first-
hand information that has been of enormous assistance
to us in correctly assessing the situations under
consideration and in taking the necessary decisions.
I wish to thank all my colleagues for having
participated in the debate we proposed on the subject
of peace-building. I also wish to thank the experts who
worked on the final document, which, in an admirable
consensus, demonstrated the importance we all attach
to peace-building in all its phases.
On behalf of my delegation, I also wish to thank
the Secretariat and all the Departments that once again
displayed their traditional unfailing readiness to
provide us with very useful and detailed information.
We also extend our thanks to the entire team led by Mr.
Stephanides, which was there to initiate us long before
our presidency, for their advice, professionalism,
discipline and willingness to work 24 hours a day,
weekends included. It is a veritable hive of activity
whose work, perfectly synchronized with that of the
presidency, and, above all, whose useful and high-
quality output one can fully appreciate only when one
occupies this seat.
As for the interpreters, they have been wonderful.
They have been able to convey our thoughts, the
nuances of our words and even our emotions with
unfailing faithfulness and rigour. We extend our thanks
to all of them in all six languages.

We have brought Africa to the Council. Members
have heard its voice. They have heard its cries of pain
and its aspirations to a better future. I urge members
always to give Africa their attention. It is fully entitled
to rise from its troubles.
I wish every success to the delegation of Ukraine,
which will be assuming this seat in the coming hours.
Ukraine, like us, will appreciate members‚Äô fullest
cooperation.
Finally, I should like once again to reiterate our
thanks to Ambassador Soderberg, who has been our
friend throughout the past three years and who, through
her participation and spirit of cooperation, has given us
all the cooperation we have always enjoyed from the
United States. We thank her once again as she prepares
to leave her post in the Security Council.
The meeting rose at 11.30 a.m.
