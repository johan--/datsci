The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Somalia in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Hashi

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/1035, which contains the letter dated
4 November 2003 addressed to the President of the
Security Council from the Chairman of the Security

751 (1992) concerning Somalia. Members of the
Council also have before them document S/2003/1177,
which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in
the course of the Council's prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
