The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.
Expression of thanks to the retiring President
The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of August 2009, I should
like to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of
the Council, to our Ugandan colleagues for their service
in the presidency of the Security Council for the month
of July 2009. I am sure I speak for all members of the
Security Council in expressing great admiration for the
way in which Ambassador Rugunda and his team
conducted the Council’s business last month.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Children and armed conflict

Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Since
this is the first meeting of the Security Council under
the current presidency of the United Kingdom, allow
me to warmly congratulate you, Ambassador Sawers,
on your assumption of the presidency of the Council
for the month of August. I am certain that you will have
S/PV.6176

excellent memories of your time on the Security Council
in your future career. I would also like to express to
Ambassador Ruhakana Rugunda and his team from the
delegation of Uganda our thanks and recognition for
their excellent work during the month of July.
In my capacity as Chair of the Security Council
Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, and
in my national capacity, I am very pleased to be able to
take the floor now that the Security Council has
unanimously adopted resolution 1882 (2009), by which
it reaffirms its unequivocal commitment to the
protection of children in situations of armed conflict.
This is a new, significant step by the United Nations
for the protection of children.
With this resolution, the Security Council is
sending a very clear political signal that the obligations
imposed by international law on the parties to an armed
conflict with regard to the safety, security and well-
being of children must be respected, with no
exceptions whatsoever.
Resolution 1882 (2009) is a fundamental step
forward in the agenda for the protection of children. By
broadening the criteria whereby parties to an armed
conflict can be included in the reports that Secretary-
General presents annually on this issue. In this way, the
responsibility of the parties who, in contravention of
international law, commit murder and maiming as well
as rape and other forms of sexual violence against
children can be considered by the Security Council.
Closely linked to the previous point, the
resolution deals with major aspects inherent in the
broadening of criteria, especially for the preparation of
plans of action that are directed at putting an end to the
practices of recruitment, killing, maiming and sexual
violence. Likewise, in order to fight impunity, the
resolution calls on States to take action to bring to
national and international justice the perpetrators of
crimes against children in situations of armed conflict.
The resolution contributes to transparency by
asking the Secretary-General to make public the
criteria and procedures used for listing and de-listing in
his reports parties to conflicts that commit these crimes
and by asking that timely information be exchanged
with the Governments concerned through his Special
Representative.
For all these reasons, resolution 1882 (2009) is a
formidable tool for the Office of the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, UNICEF, the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the United
Nations monitoring teams and other actors, such as
non-governmental organizations, which, on a daily basis,
carry out their tireless work to improve the situation of
children in many regions of the world. All of this will
enhance the image and credibility of our Organization.
This resolution fulfils the commitment made by
the Security Council during the Mexican presidency in
April to take concrete action within three months to
address the killing and maiming as well as rape and
other forms of sexual violence committed against
children.
In that regard, we can say that resolution 1882
(2009) is the most relevant development in this area
since 2005, when the Security Council adopted
resolution 1612 (2005), which created the monitoring
and reporting mechanism and the Working Group on
Children and Armed Conflict.
It is clear that in the past few years the Security
Council has made substantial progress on this agenda.
Nevertheless, we must also recognize that there is still
much left to be done if we want children never again to
fall victim to the spiral of violence that armed conflicts
generate.
When assuming the great responsibility of
chairing the Working Group, Mexico knew that we
would need the will of all members of the Security
Council if we were to achieve the objective of
improving the protection of children in situations of
armed conflict. In this framework, the initiative
adopted today is a substantial contribution on which
Mexico had the privilege of leading the collective
effort of the members of this Council. I wish to express
my personal thanks to the group of experts that
undertook this task. I wish also to express my deep
appreciation to the Office of the Special
Representative, Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy, and to
UNICEF, for their tireless support and counsel.
I wish to conclude by acknowledging, on behalf
of my delegation, the support given by all members of
the Security Council to this resolution, and by
acknowledging the large number of States Members of
the United Nations that joined in sponsoring it.
The President: I thank the representative of
Mexico for his and his delegation’s leadership on this
important issue in the Council.

Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): I do
not wish to let this opportunity pass, Mr. President,
without extending my cordial congratulations to you and
your Mission. I wish you the very best as you assume
the presidency. You can count on our cooperation.
I should also like to thank Ambassador Rugunda
and the entire Ugandan delegation for their very
successful leadership of our work in July.
More than a decade has passed since the Security
Council first considered the issue of children and
armed conflict. Since then, six resolutions have been
adopted. In various ways, the decision to strengthen the
framework for the protection of children in conflict
situations has been enacted in deed. The adoption of
resolution 1882 (2009) significantly strengthens that
framework and broadens the mechanisms provided for
in resolutions 1539 (2004) and 1612 (2005).
The inclusion of two new criteria or triggers —
sexual violence and killing and maiming — is testimony
to the Security Council’s resolve to respond effectively
to the two most serious and frequently committed crimes
against children in situations of armed conflict. We
must continue to expand that progressive focus, while
avoiding the establishment of artificial hierarchies.
The resolution addresses two issues to which
Costa Rica attaches importance. We stress the need to
improve communication and the exchange of
information between the Working Group on Children
and Armed Conflict and the sanctions committees, as
well as the importance of making the issue of children
an integral part of reports on situations in specific
countries. Of equal importance are the calls to follow
up on the recommendations of the Working Group; the
fight against impunity and referrals of cases to
international justice, when necessary; and the call for
timely and sustained response in the rehabilitation of
children affected by conflict.
Effective progress based on the resolution we
have just adopted will depend on the performance of
some important tasks. The first involves the
implementation of action plans, which may be the most
useful tool in attaining tangible results. Unfortunately,
in many cases no such plans have been elaborated; in
other cases, they have not been adopted. Costa Rica
therefore welcomes the call for the consistent
implementation of action plans and the information we
are to receive on progress made in that respect. We also
trust that such plans will henceforth include a
component for the provision of comprehensive and
sustained treatment to the victims of rape.
We also believe that the technology support of the
Secretariat is necessary. It will help to systematize the
information provided to the Working Group and to
consolidate the historic memory of recommendations
to the parties. This is an indispensable follow-up and
accountability mechanism for the assessment and
evaluation of the actions needed for compliance,
especially with respect to repeated offenders.
The time is also ripe for improving the
monitoring and reporting mechanism in order to make
it more useful in the identification of trends and
patterns of violations, and in the promotion of a
strategic vision of possible solutions. Finally, we
believe it necessary to establish objective criteria and
procedures for inclusion on and exclusion from the
annexed lists in the Secretary-General’s reports, which
will guarantee transparency, objectivity and consistency.
Before concluding, my delegation wishes to
recognize the work undertaken by the delegation of
Mexico to reach the agreements that allowed us to adopt
this instrument of protection. We also thank all the
members of the Working Group for their constructive
attitude during negotiations, and Ms. Coomaraswamy
and UNICEF for the support they provided to us.
Similarly, on behalf of the Human Security Network,
which Costa Rica will chair until May 2010, we
welcome the conclusion of the process leading to
today’s adoption of resolution 1882 (2009). The
protection of children in armed conflict has been a
priority issue for the Human Security Network since its
establishment.
The President: I thank the representative of
Costa Rica for his kind words addressed to me.
There are no further speakers on my list. On
behalf of the entire Security Council, I thank those who
have been closely involved with this agenda item —
the Ambassador of Mexico, Ms. Coomaraswamy, and
the staff and leadership of UNICEF — for their
important work on this dossier.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 3.25 p.m.
