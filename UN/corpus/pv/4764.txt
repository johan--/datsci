S/PV.4764
The meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of
the Congo
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, in which he requests to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council’s agenda.
In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with
the consent of the Council, to invite that representative
to participate in the discussion, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ileka
(Democratic Republic of the Congo) took a seat
at the Council table.
The President: I welcome the presence of the
Secretary-General at this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/578, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
I should like to draw the Council’s attention to
the following amendments to the draft resolution.
In paragraph 5, the words “and human rights law”
should be deleted. Accordingly, the paragraph should
read as follows:
“Demands that all the parties to the conflict
in Ituri and in particular in Bunia cease hostilities
immediately and reiterates that international
humanitarian law must be respected, and that
there will be no impunity for violators.”
In paragraph 7, the words “respect human rights”
should be added after the words “the Great Lakes
region”. The paragraph should therefore begin as
follows.
“Demands that all Congolese parties and all
States in the Great Lakes region respect human
rights, cooperate with the Interim Emergency
Multinational Force and with MONUC ...”.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution, as orally
amended, before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
now put to the vote the draft resolution, as orally
amended.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution, as orally amended, has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1484 (2003).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 10.30 a.m.
