The meeting was called to order at 4.25 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
General issues relating to sanctions
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations. Members of the Council have before
them document S/2006/996, which contains the text of
a draft resolution submitted by Argentina, Denmark,
France, Greece, Japan, Peru, the Russian Federation,
Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1730 (2006).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mrs. Collet (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 1730
(2006), which is the result of the reaching of fresh
insights and of a collective effort pursued, in particular,
within the Security Council Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning
Al-Qaida and the Taliban. It is a meaningful
contribution to improving delisting procedures for
sanctions committee lists.
With the development of sanctions regimes aimed
at individuals or entities, rather than at countries, the
inadequacy of delisting procedures has gradually
become apparent. There has been a widespread sense
that, once a name has been added to a list, it is difficult
to delist it and to plead one’s case, since the procedure
has been so opaque and inaccessible. That has affected
the efficacy of sanctions.
The procedure we have just adopted, which
complements that for States’ submission of requests,
enables individuals and entities that have been listed to
present their petitions for delisting directly to a focal
point created to that end within the Secretariat. As in
the various sanctions committees, the new mechanism
will make the procedure more accessible, clearer and
standardized. It will also ensure that all submissions
will be considered by the sanctions committees within
a reasonable delay. It therefore represents considerable
progress in terms of equity and transparency.
My country expresses the hope that, by thus
facilitating requests for delisting, the new procedure
will strengthen the support of States for the sanctions
regimes. France is convinced that such support will
guarantee the effectiveness of targeted sanctions, an
important instrument in the maintenance of
international peace and security.
Ms. Løj (Denmark): Denmark is pleased to have
been a sponsor of the resolution just adopted,
improving the delisting procedures of all the Security
Council sanctions committees. In our assessment, that
is the best achievable result at this point in time, and
certainly a step in the right direction.
Improving the listing and delisting procedures of
the sanctions committees in general, and of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267
(1999) in particular, has been a priority for Denmark
since we joined the Security Council in 2005. In
October 2005, we put forward a proposal to establish
an independent review mechanism that would consider
individual petitions for delisting from individuals and
entities and make recommendations to the Council. We
believe that this procedure would significantly improve
on the current procedures and hope that the Council
will give the proposal due consideration, including
when Denmark is no longer a member of the Council.
In Denmark’s view, improved procedures
strengthen our common fight against terrorism and our
targeted sanctions. Improved procedures make the
sanctions committees more credible and more
effective, thus providing all States with a stronger
S/PV.5599
306-67095
incentive to engage early and actively in the
implementation of sanctions. We strongly urge the
Security Council to continue its work on ensuring fair
and clear procedures for listing and delisting.
Mrs. Papadopoulou (Greece): Greece co-
sponsored the present resolution because we believe
that it is a positive first step in addressing concerns
regarding the need to establish procedural fairness
within the current system of delisting procedures. In
our view, by allowing individuals and entities listed to
have direct access to the committees’ delisting
procedures, the resolution enhances the effectiveness
and credibility of the relevant sanctions regime.
We believe, however, that the sanctions
committees should continue to improve their delisting
procedures, particularly in the direction of establishing
a review mechanism along the lines of the useful
suggestions made recently by such member States as
Denmark, and other relevant processes. The
improvement of targeted sanctions regimes is
important if sanctions are to be a credible tool in the
hands of the Security Council.
Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
Argentina, too, was a sponsor of today’s resolution, on
which France and the United States did the preliminary
work. In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999), which
provided the framework for debate, I thank all
Committee members for their constructive
contributions to the discussions on reformulating the
listing and delisting procedures of the sanctions
committees.
The changes represent progress in the defence of
human rights and in awareness-raising among all
members of the Council on the need to operate — both
in the fight against the terrorism of Al-Qaida and the
Taliban and in the context of the work of the other
sanctions committees — in respect for the law and
human rights. I recall that those objectives represent
Argentina’s core convictions over the past two years in
its capacity as a non-permanent member of the Security
Council.
The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Qatar.
Issues related to the fairness of the listing and
delisting procedures of the Security Council’s
sanctions committees are of interest to many. The
Security Council must ensure respect for legal
standards and norms, as well as for transparency, in
listing and delisting procedures. Heads of State and
Government and the General Assembly at last year’s
World Summit called on the Security Council to
ensure, with the support of the Secretary-General, fair
and clear listing and delisting of individuals and
entities on sanctions lists, and to grant humanitarian
exceptions.
The Secretary-General is to be commended for
his 15 June 2006 recommendations to one of the
sanctions committees relating to delisting procedures,
particularly following my delegation’s assertion of the
need for the Secretary-General to assume his
responsibility in that regard. The Secretary-General
stated in a letter that listed persons have the right, inter
alia, to an effective appeals mechanism. The
effectiveness of such a mechanism depends primarily
on its independence, neutrality and fairness and on
effective recourse by those listed to delisting and just
compensation.
International, national and regional courts must
review Security Council resolutions to ensure that they
comply fully with internationally recognized human
rights norms and the principles and purposes of the
United Nations Charter. On 22 June 2006, in its
statement on strengthening international law, the rule
of law and the maintenance of international peace and
security, the Security Council committed itself to
establishing fair and clear procedures for listing
individuals and entities in sanctions’ lists.
My delegation voted in favour of today’s
resolution so that the Security Council might reaffirm
its commitment to managing sanctions as carefully as
possible and in such a way as to ensure balance
between effectiveness and potential negative
consequences, and to following clear and fair
procedures for listing and delisting individuals and
entities and for granting humanitarian exceptions. We
continue to believe that there is hope for the Council’s
ability to improve procedures on delisting from
sanctions’ lists.
Although we voted in favour of the draft
resolution, we have some comments to make on its
annex, which represents a very modest and weak
attempt by the Council to improve the delisting
procedures. We remain gravely concerned that the
S/PV.5599
06-670954
resolution failed to respect many legal norms and
standards that should be respected and applied by both
the Security Council and its sanctions Committees in
the delisting of individuals. Today the Council
established a focal point that lacks independence,
neutrality, standards or controls for delisting.
Therefore, this point of contact does not at all
constitute an effective means of fairness.
We express our regret that the sponsors of the
resolution did not take up our proposal to allow legal
representatives of listed persons to petition for
delisting, not just by those listed on the sanctions’ lists,
especially since some listed persons are now deceased.
At this point one may wonder how the deceased
persons are to submit their requests for delisting, given
that they are dead. Despite the fact that it was sound
and logical, the sponsors also decided to set this
important proposal aside.
We also suggested that delisting requests could be
submitted through the focal point to the Secretary-
General or to United Nations offices working in or near
the State of nationality or residence of the individual
concerned. Regrettably, once again, that proposal was
not accepted by the co-sponsors.
My delegation proposed that, at a minimum, the
Committee should be able to provide necessary
recommendations in reviewing requests for delisting.
Once again, that proposal, regrettably, was not
acceptable to the sponsors.
We hope that the Security Council will review the
annex, and indeed the entire issue, and that there will
be transparency, objectivity and independence in the
consideration of delisting requests. We also hope that
there will be more respect for the rules of international
law and norms and for the legitimate calls of heads of
State and Government, international and regional
organizations, governmental and non-governmental
organizations and the many States that respect human
rights and the rule of law.
Through the resolution, the Security Council
commits itself to improving the listing and delisting
procedures and procedures regarding the granting of
humanitarian exceptions. That was the sole reason for
our voting in favour of the resolution, as well as the
hope that the Security Council would fulfil its
commitments, especially with regard to delisting. We
look forward to its doing so next year.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 4.40 p.m.
