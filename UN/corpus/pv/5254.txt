The situation in Sierra Leone

The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Sierra Leone in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Rowe
(Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
documents S/2005/273 and addenda 1 and 2, which
contain the twenty-fifth report of the Secretary-General
on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2005/554, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by a show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
