The meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Cyprus
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2006/931)
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus, document S/2006/931.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/978, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by China, France, the
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.
I now give the floor to members of the Council
wishing to make statements before the vote.
Mr. Vassilakis (Greece): Today is the last time
that Greece will participate, in its capacity as a non-
permanent member of the Security Council, in a
meeting on an issue of the utmost importance for my
country: Cyprus. I would therefore like to take this
opportunity to express my country‚Äôs most heartfelt
appreciation, first of all, to the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and to the
Department for Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and
the Secretariat in general for all their hard work and
their contribution to maintaining stability on the island,
which is so necessary for the promotion of any
solution.
We also thank greatly all troop-contributing
countries for their continued presence. We all
understand very well the magnitude of the ever-
increasing global demands on United Nations
peacekeeping resources, and we are mindful of the
need to ensure that UNFICYP does not stay one day
more than is absolutely necessary. We sincerely hope
that that day will come very soon. In the meanwhile,
though, and in the absence of a comprehensive
settlement and the withdrawal of all occupation troops
from the island, UNFICYP is necessary, and the
contribution of the United Nations is highly
appreciated and, of course, never taken for granted.
Greece shows that appreciation in practical terms
as well, by providing, on a voluntary basis, a
substantial amount of money for UNFICYP. That
contribution and the one third share of the expenses
contributed by the Government of Cyprus amount to
50 per cent of the Force's yearly budget.
The Cyprus problem is a long-standing and
complicated one. But, despite many, and quite
intensive, efforts over the years, unfortunately, 32
years after the Turkish military invasion, its resolution
remains elusive. We remain hopeful that the lessons
drawn from our past efforts will not be in vain and that,
instead, they will guide us ‚Äî all of us ‚Äî in the search
for a functional and workable solution acceptable to all
and desired by all. This will lead to a better future for
all of the citizens of Cyprus and will contribute to
peace and stability in the entire region.
A Cypriot-owned solution through a Cypriot-
owned process with the invaluable assistance of the
international community: that is the way forward. We
know it is a difficult way. There might be setbacks, and
patience will be a quality in great demand. But we
should always bear in mind that no step is too small if
it is in the right, forward-looking, direction. Step-by-
step approaches could lead to major breakthroughs.
We all agree that the present status quo is
unsustainable. The two communities have also agreed
on the basic form of the reunification of the island: a
bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. We now have to
build upon what has already been achieved. The 8 July
agreement gives us a platform on which to work
carefully to prepare the ground so that we can achieve
the necessary progress that will allow the entire
political process to move forward and lead to a
comprehensive, permanent and durable settlement: a
settlement that respects international legality and
conforms with both the relevant United Nations
resolutions and the norms and principles of the
European Union.
In closing, I would like to thank the members of
the Security Council for their close cooperation and
their understanding of the difficulties of a particularly
complex problem ‚Äî especially, if one takes into
account the sensitivities involved in this particular
S/PV.5593
306-66340
case, which has deep roots in history and is tightly
interwoven with larger geopolitical realities.
The President (spoke in Arabic): It is my
understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to
the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I have met with
the representatives of the parties, who have confirmed
to me that they maintain their well-known positions
vis-√†-vis the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. On the
basis of those meetings, as President, with the consent
of the members of the Council, I have drawn the
conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision on the draft resolution (S/2006/978) before it.
If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1728 (2006).
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.35 a.m.
