to promote the heightened efforts of the international
community to combat the dangers and threats posed
by nuclear proliferation. We consider it important that
such efforts continue.
We also value the role played by the Group of
Experts of the 1540 Committee. Without the support
provided by the experts to Member States, and to
developing countries in particular, it would be difficult
for many to establish plans of action, present national
reports and make progress on the measures necessary
to comply with the provisions of resolution 1540 (2004).
We believe that it is necessary to respect the criteria
for selecting the experts, as established under resolution
1977 (2011), as they meet the legitimate interests of
the international community to have at its disposal, in
addition to the most qualified people, a group that is
diverse and reflects a balance of representation among
its members. The criteria on which the selection of
experts is based are an important factor for ensuring
that the 1540 Committee maintains its legitimacy.
In that regard, we should have preferred the criteria
to be respected in the selection of the members of
the Group of Experts referred to in resolution 2055
(2012), which we have just adopted, without additional
budgetary implications beyond those already foreseen.
It was only on the basis of our desire not to see the
work of the 1540 Committee affected that we joined
the consensus on this occasion, despite our reservations
concerning the final composition of the Group of
Experts.
The President (spoke in Chinese): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 9.50 a.m.
The meeting was called to order at 9.45 a.m.

important and useful work since their establishment
