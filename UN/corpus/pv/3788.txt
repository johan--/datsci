Report of the Secretary-General on the situation in
Tajikistan (S/1997/415)
The President (interpretation from Russian): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Tajikistan, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Alimov
(Tajikistan) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (interpretation from Russian): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan,
document S/1997/415.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1997/444, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s prior
consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents:
S/1997/385, letter dated 20 May 1997 from the Permanent
Representative of Kyrgyzstan to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General, transmitting the text
of the Protocol on Political Questions and the Bishkek
Memorandum signed at the conclusion of the inter-Tajik
talks in Bishkek on 18 May 1997; and S/1997/410, letter
dated 28 May 1997 from the Permanent Representative of
the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General, transmitting the text
of the Protocol on the Guarantees of Implementation of
the General Agreement on Establishment of Peace and
National Accord in Tajikistan, signed by the delegations
of the Republic of Tajikistan and of the United Tajik
Opposition in Tehran on 28 May 1997.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/1997/444) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now
put the draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
