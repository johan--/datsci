The agenda was adopted.
The situation between Iraq and Kuwait
Thirty-fifth report of the Secretary-General
pursuant to paragraph 14 of resolution 1284
(1999) (S/2013/357)
Letter dated 12 June 2013 from the
Permanent Representatives of Iraq and
Kuwait to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General (S/2013/358)
The President: Under rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative
of Iraq to participate in this meeting.
On behalf of the Council, I welcome the presence
at the Council table of His Excellency Mr. Hoshyar
Zebari, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2013/379, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Australia, France, Morocco, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2013/357, which contains the thirty-fifth
report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 14
of resolution 1284 (1999), and to document S/2013/358,
which contains a letter dated 12 June 2013 from the
Permanent Representatives of Kuwait and Iraq to the
United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, China, France,
Guatemala, Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan,
Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda,
Togo, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2107 (2013).
I now give the floor to Mr. Zebari:
Mr. Zebari (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset,
allow me to thank you, Sir, for convening this important
meeting and to express my appreciation to the countries
that sponsored resolution 2107 (2013) and contributed
to its enrichment, and to the friendly the members of
the Security Council that voted on adopting it.
I cannot but express my Government‚Äôs gratitude
to the Secretary-General for his report contained
in document S/2013/357, which contains important
proposals and evaluations, and to the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), led by Special
Representative of the Secretary General Martin Kobler,
for its efforts to fulfil the requirements of its mandate
in Iraq, as well to the State and Government of Kuwait
for their support and assistance to Iraq in emerging
from under the provisions of Chapter VII. I also wish
to express our gratitude and appreciation to the late
Ambassador Vorontsov and Mr. Tarasov, the high-level
coordinators, for their efforts to achieve progress in
the humanitarian files of missing Kuwaiti persons and
property.
The Security Council meets today to adopt a
resolution in the context of resolutions and measures
taken by the Council to remove Iraq from the
provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United
Nations. When we carefully consider the past few
years, we can see how far Iraq has come along the
path of constructive cooperation with the objective
of enabling Iraq to finally fulfil all its obligations
under Security Council resolutions. Our foreign policy
and international relations have been focused mainly
on how to free the people and country of Iraq of the
burdens of those resolutions. Those burdens would
never have been imposed on Iraq had it not been for
the aggressive policies of the former regime of waging
wars against its neighbours and internally against its
own people. Those resolutions have hindered Iraq‚Äôs
progress, prosperity and integration into the regional
and international communities.
Looking back at what we have achieved over the
past few years towards Iraq regaining the international
standing it enjoyed prior to resolution 661 (1990), we
note the crucial resolution 1762 (2007), which ended
the mandate of the United Nations Commission on
13-37599 3
S/PV.6990
As for the issue of compensation, Iraq is
committed to paying the percentage decided by the
Security Council based on the mechanism set out by
the United Nations Commission on Compensation, as
cited in resolution 1956 (2010) under the mechanism
of the successor arrangements for the Development
Fund for Iraq. We therefore believe that, through the
adoption of resolution 2107 (2013), Iraq has fulfilled
all its obligations under the resolutions of the Security
Council under Chapter VII of the Charter.
We believe that today‚Äôs date, 27 June 2013, would
be a milestone in the history of the relationship between
Iraq and the international community, indicating that
the resolutions imposed on Iraq under Chapter VII of
the Charter now belong to the past. This date will also
represent a significant development in the relationship
between Iraq and Kuwait. All the negative aspects
of the relationship between the two countries are
now bygone, and we will focus on the present, on the
future, and on what brotherly relations can achieve to
consolidate peace, security and stability in the region.
We shall focus on directing the efforts of these two
rich countries to promote sustainable development
that reflects positive results on both countries and the
Arab region. The achieved cooperation between Iraq
and Kuwait will serve as a model for resolving disputes
between States by peaceful means.
Iraq is a rich country, possessing wealth and human,
material and natural resources that qualify to play an
important, indeed critical role in ensuring the stability
of the Middle East. Although these capabilities have
been affected by the challenges to our internal political
process, the war on terrorism, and regional political
changes, all Iraqi parties involved in the political process
are united in their resolve to confront these challenges
through a national partnership that prioritizes national
interests above all else and benefits the stability of
the region. All Iraqi parties will work to secure social
peace and to prevent Iraq from returning to sectarian
fighting. We will resort to our Constitution to resolve
our issues and to the polls to choose our representatives
in the provincial councils and the Government.
In the recent past, we have already held successful
provincial elections, and will convene the upcoming
legislative elections by adhering to the same principles
that we have upheld in previous elections, which
were characterized by transparency and integrity and
monitored by the international community. This will
result in a Government elected by the people that leads
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.
The resolution strengthened the sovereignty of Iraq,
lifted the weight of political constraints from its
shoulders, paved the way for Iraq‚Äôs return to the regional
and international communities, and contributed to the
stability of the region.
Resolution 1762 (2007) represented the international
community‚Äôs recognition of the correct approach
taken by Iraq in fulfilling its obligations in the field
of disarmament and non-proliferation. It is with great
pride that Iraq currently chairs the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva, which confirms the validity
of the path Iraq has taken, particularly after the
ratification of the Additional Protocol to the Safeguards
Agreement of the International Atomic Energy Agency
and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
Furthermore, in resolution 1859 (2008), the Council
decided to review the resolutions concerning the
situation between Iraq and Kuwait and the situation in
Iraq in order to identify together the mutual obligations
falling to the international community, represented
by the Council, and to Iraq. As a result, the Council
adopted three important resolutions on 15 December
2010 ‚Äî resolutions 1956 (2010), 1957 (2010) and 1958
(2010) ‚Äî under which all of Iraq‚Äôs obligations were
ended, with the exception of three issues relating to the
situation between Iraq and Kuwait: missing Kuwaitis
and property, the maintenance of the border, and
compensation.
With regard to the first issue, significant progress
has been achieved under bilateral cooperation between
the two countries. None of that cooperation could have
been achieved without the serious cooperation of the
Iraqi authorities. We shall continue to cooperate and to
step up the pace of our cooperation in the near future,
now that the issue has been transferred to coverage
under the provisions of Chapter VI of the Charter.
With respect to the maintenance of border markers,
Iraq and Kuwait have created a mechanism through the
establishment of a joint ministerial committee, and put
in place the necessary measures indicated in resolution
833 (1993). In that regard, I refer to the letter of the
Secretary-General to President of the Security Council
dated of 12 June 2013 (S/2013/358), which refers to the
end of the mission entrusted to him under resolution
833 (1993). Therefore, on this basis, Iraq has fulfilled
all its obligations under that resolution.

S/PV.6990
to cooperate with international organizations, the
United Nations first and foremost, and to make such
cooperation the foundation of our foreign policy and
international relations. As a responsible and fully
sovereign country, Iraq has regained to its natural place
in the international community. It will play a positive
and constructive role in promoting peace and stability
and in achieving development for its people and the
region. Just as Iraq was the cradle of civilization, it will
be the cradle of cooperation, peace and fraternity for its
people, its neighbours and the world.
From this international forum, I congratulate the
people of Iraq on the great achievements of the current
and previous Governments in freeing our country from
the burden of sanctions and embargoes, and on their
efforts to achieve prosperity and security.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11.20 a.m.
a democratic, federal Iraq to progress, security and
stability and contributes to the security of the region.
Having discharged all the requirements of the
international community, we still face two main
challenges. First and foremost, we must win the war
on terrorism and defeat religious extremism, which we
cannot do without national efforts and international
cooperation, because terrorism has assumed a cross-
border, global dimension and cannot be defeated
without international cooperation.
The second challenge is reconstructing Iraq in
such a way that guarantees sustainable development for
future generations. This, too, will be difficult to achieve
without a peaceful environment and international
assistance. We therefore look to the international
community for its assistance in order to achieve our
goals.
In conclusion, we reiterate our gratitude and
appreciation to the Security Council. Iraq will continue
