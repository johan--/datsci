tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency Mr.
Heraldo Muñoz, Permanent Representative of Chile to
the United Nations, for his service as President of the

sure I speak for all members of the Council in
expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Muñoz

The situation in Côte d’Ivoire

Nations Mission in Côte d’Ivoire submitted
pursuant to Security Council resolution 1514
(2003) of 13 November 2003 (S/2004/3)
The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Côte d’Ivoire, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Djangone-Bi
(Côte d’Ivoire), took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Mission in Côte d’Ivoire, document S/2004/3.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2004/82, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the Council’s prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

matter.
