The Security Council will now begin its

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2011/741, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the situation in Abyei.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,

The President (spoke in Russian): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been

As this could be the last public meeting of the
Security Council for December 2011, I would like, on
behalf of the Council, to express the sincere
appreciation of the Council to the five outgoing
members, namely, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil,
Gabon, Lebanon and Nigeria. I commend their hard
work and contributions during their 2010-2011 term on
