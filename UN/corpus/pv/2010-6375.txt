Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Letter dated 11 August 2010 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the President
of the Security Council (S/2010/430)
The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Belgium, Israel, Italy and Spain,
in which they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Waxman
(Israel) took a seat at the Council table; the
representatives of the other aforementioned
countries took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council Chamber.
The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/454, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, France, Italy,
Spain and the United States of America. I wish to draw
the attention of participants to documents S/2010/352
and S/2010/430, containing the thirteenth report of the
Secretary-General on Security Council resolution 1701
(2006) and a letter dated 11 August 2010 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the President of the
Security Council, respectively.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America.
The President (spoke in Russian): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1937 (2010).
I now give the floor to the representative of
Lebanon, who wishes to make a statement following
the voting.
Mr. Salam (Lebanon): Allow me, first, to extend
the thanks of the Government of Lebanon to all
members of the Security Council for the unanimous
decision to renew for another year the mandate of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),
without amendment to its mission, its rules of
engagement or its concept of operations, as per the
request of my Government.
I would also like to take this opportunity to praise
UNIFIL‚Äôs dedicated work, in close coordination and
cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces; to
commend the leadership of its Commander, Major
General Asarta Cuevas; and to express our deep
gratitude to all troop-contributing countries for their
continued support to Lebanon and its efforts to
consolidate security and stability in its south. Lebanon
appreciates the troops‚Äô valiant sacrifices, the most
recent of which being the regrettable death of a French
UNIFIL member in a car accident last week. Allow me
also to acknowledge the guidance provided by the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
I know that this is well known to all members of
the Security Council, however allow me to conclude by
reiterating Lebanon‚Äôs strong commitment to the full
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) in its
entirety.
The President (spoke in Russian): I now give the
floor to the representative of Israel.
Mr. Waxman (Israel): As we are meeting at the
end of the month, please allow me, Mr. President, to
commend you for your able stewardship of the Security
Council this month.
S/PV.6375
310-49885
Israel welcomes the adoption of resolution 1937
(2010) and the renewal of the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). I would
like to convey Israel‚Äôs appreciation to UNIFIL troops
and their commanders, troop-contributing countries
and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations
(DPKO).
Israel remains committed to the full
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and looks
forward to cooperating with the Security Council, the
Secretary-General, DPKO and UNIFIL in that regard.
However, in Lebanon, serious challenges to peace and
security threaten the full realization of resolution 1701
(2006). In fact, some of those challenges are
highlighted in the resolution that the Council has just
adopted.
The most serious of these remains the military
build-up of the Hizbullah terrorist organization. With
Iranian and Syrian support through arms, training and
financing ‚Äî all of which are flagrant violations of
resolution 1701 (2006) and of today‚Äôs resolution ‚Äî
Hizbullah is building a deadly arsenal throughout
Lebanon, including south of the Litani River and in the
area of UNIFIL‚Äôs operation. The incidents in Khirbat
Silim, Tayr Filsi and Mazraat Sarda represent just the
tip of the iceberg of this larger phenomenon. This
military build-up is made possible by widespread
weapons transfers to Lebanon, which violate the
existing arms embargo. The arms embargo is a key
issue addressed in resolution 1701 (2006). The
reference to the embargo in today‚Äôs resolution is
certainly important and should be accompanied by
concrete measures on the ground.
Hizbullah‚Äôs deadly rearmament endangers
Lebanon itself and the wider Middle East as Hizbullah
deploys those weapons and builds its military
infrastructure throughout civilian villages of southern
Lebanon, adjacent to schools, hospitals, houses of
worship and residential buildings. Hence, more
concerted efforts must be made in order to establish, in
the words of paragraph 8 of today‚Äôs resolution,
‚Äúbetween the Blue Line and the Litani River ... an area
free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other
than those of the Government of Lebanon and
UNIFIL‚Äù.
The freedom of movement of UNIFIL is
increasingly impeded by Hizbullah operatives who use
civilians to disrupt the work of peacekeepers. In that
regard, UNIFIL must remain vigilant and use the
necessary and appropriate means to carry out the
mandate that the Council has renewed today.
While Israel welcomes the deployment of the
Lebanese Army in southern Lebanon, its forces must
act responsibly to ensure peace and stability. The
Lebanese Armed Forces must clearly differentiate itself
from radical elements that seek to undermine
resolution 1701 (2006). In that regard, on 3 August we
witnessed a grave incident. During routine Israeli work
south of the Blue Line ‚Äî more than 90 metres within
Israeli territory ‚Äî Lebanese forces fired direct fire
across the Blue Line, killing Battalion Commander
Lieutenant Colonel Dov Harari and critically wounding
another senior company commander, both of whom
were standing some 140 metres south of the Blue Line
and 250 metres west of the location of the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) works.
The preliminary findings concerning this incident
were discussed in the Secretary-General‚Äôs letter to the
Security Council regarding the renewal of UNIFIL‚Äôs
mandate (S/2010/430). UNIFIL‚Äôs investigation was
shared with the parties last week, and the main finding
of the report states that
‚Äúthe LAF [Lebanese Armed Forces] opening fire,
which triggered the exchange, constitutes a
serious violation of resolution 1701 (2006) and a
flagrant breach of the cessation of hostilities. At
the time of the initial LAF fire, the IDF troops
were positioned on the Israeli side, south of the
Blue Line‚Äù.
The parties plan to discuss the results of this
investigation in their next tripartite meeting. However,
Israel hopes that the Council will receive a full briefing
on the matter in a timely manner. This type of incident
must not happen again. Israel reiterates its call upon
the LAF to respect the Blue Line in its entirety.
While the situation in southern Lebanon remains
complex, the presence of UNIFIL plays an
indispensable role in promoting calm in the area,
including along Israel‚Äôs northern border. In conclusion,
I wish to reiterate our support for today‚Äôs resolution,
and to emphasize our gratitude to the men and women
of UNIFIL, who are performing a difficult task in a
difficult environment in order to promote peace and
security for all in the region.

The President (spoke in Russian): The
representative of Lebanon has asked for the floor to
make a further statement, and I call on him now.
Mr. Salam (Lebanon): As we renew the mandate
of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) today, it is important not to forget that the
current enhanced mission of UNIFIL came on the heels
of the Israeli war on Lebanon in 2006, which killed
1,125 Lebanese civilians and displaced hundreds of
thousands, not to mention those civilians who have
since been mutilated by the cluster bombs that Israel
dropped in the last 48 hours of its aggression. In fact,
the criminal fallout of Israel‚Äôs 2006 aggression
continues to unfold. During the past four months,
‚Äúseven incidents involving unexploded ordnance from
the 2006 conflict occurred, resulting in injury to six
civilians and one deminer‚Äù, as stated in paragraph 43
of the Secretary-General‚Äôs most recent report
(S/2010/352) on the implementation of resolution 1701
(2006).
Israel claims to be committed to the full
implementation of Security Council resolution 1701
(2006). Yet, as stated by the Secretary-General in
paragraph 56 of his July report, Israeli warplanes
‚Äúcontinue to violate resolution 1701 (2006) and
Lebanese sovereignty on an almost daily basis
through overflights of Lebanese territory. These
overflights create a tense situation and have the
potential to trigger an incident that could rapidly
escalate‚Äù.
Furthermore, Israel continues to blatantly and
repeatedly violate Lebanese sovereignty on land and at
sea, where it unilaterally established a line of buoys
infringing on Lebanese territorial waters, in addition to
its ‚Äúnavy units dropping depth charges and firing flares
along the buoy line‚Äù, as stated in paragraph 26 of the
Secretary-General‚Äôs latest report. Is this how Israel
intends to be fully committed to the implementation of
resolution 1701 (2006)?
Four years after the Security Council adopted that
resolution, calling on Israel to withdraw its troops from
all Lebanese territory, the Israeli armed forces, as noted
in paragraph 8 of the Secretary-General‚Äôs report,
continue their ‚Äúoccupation of the northern part of
Ghajar village and an adjacent area of land north of the
Blue Line, in violation of resolution 1701 (2006)‚Äù. Is it
by continuing to defy the Secretary-General‚Äôs clear
request to withdraw from northern Ghajar that Israel
respects resolution 1701 (2006)?
Moreover, Israel continues to occupy the Shab‚Äôa
farms in the Kafr Shuba hills, refusing a solution even
on an interim basis, as previously proposed by the
Lebanese Government. And it is impossible not to
mention the more than 150 Israeli spies arrested in
Lebanon during the past year, let alone those who fled
to Israel before the Lebanese security forces were able
to apprehend them. Do they not constitute a violation
of Lebanese sovereignty, safety and security, respect
for which is enshrined in resolution 1701 (2006)?
And what about the barrage of bellicose threats
levelled against my country and its people by Israeli
officials, promising them more death and destruction.
For Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak, it has
become ‚Äúlegitimate to hit any target that belongs to the
Lebanese State‚Äù, as he stated in his 26 July interview
with The Washington Post. Allow me also to remind
the Council that on 7 August 2009 that same Israeli
Minister declared, ahead of the renewal of UNIFIL‚Äôs
mandate last year, that ‚ÄúIsrael did not strike at
Lebanon‚Äôs infrastructure hard enough‚Äù during the
summer war of 2006. Is this how Israel promises to
respect resolution 1701 (2006)?
As for the events at the beginning of July,
Lebanon has deplored them and it reiterates its respect
for UNIFIL‚Äôs freedom of movement, as defined by its
mandate and rules of engagement. Lebanon also
considers the border incident of 3 August, which took
place in a contested area along the Blue Line, as a
grave one from which lessons should indeed be drawn.
As asserted by the report shared by UNIFIL with the
parties, the incident underscored the importance of
marking the Blue Line and respecting it. That is what
Lebanon has always been calling for.
Furthermore, the report calls on the parties to
refrain from any provocation. Lebanon fully endorses
that cardinal recommendation. Is there, however, any
greater provocation than the more than 6,000 daily,
deliberate and brazen Israeli violations of Lebanese
sovereignty perpetrated since 2006, which have been
documented and reported in numerous letters addressed
to the Council by my Mission, as well as in the
Secretary-General‚Äôs reports? Moreover, that incident
underlines how imperative it is to strengthen
coordination with UNIFIL, in order to prevent similar
events from occurring in the future. In this regard,
S/PV.6375
510-49885
Lebanon and its armed forces look forward to
enhancing their coordination and cooperation with
UNIFIL during its renewed mandate.
Allow me once more to thank you, Mr. President,
and all members of the Council for renewing UNIFIL‚Äôs
mandate for another year.
The President (spoke in Russian): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 3.35 p.m.
