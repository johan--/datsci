The meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Threats to international peace and security caused by
terrorist acts
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/647, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Austria, Burkina Faso,
Croatia, France, Japan, Mexico, Turkey, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
United States of America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1904 (2009).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria): More than four
years ago, the World Summit called upon this Council
to provide for fair and clear listing and de-listing
procedures for individuals and entities on sanctions lists.
As Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) during
the past year, I have witnessed some of the
shortcomings of the present system. I am also aware of
the growing number of cases filed by listed individuals
and entities before national and regional courts in
various parts of the world. I can therefore also
appreciate how very substantially Security Council
resolution 1904 (2009) improves the procedures under
the sanctions regime under resolution 1267 (1999) in
terms of due process. For the first time ever,
individuals and entities seeking a de-listing will have a
chance to present their cases to an independent and
impartial ombudsperson, to be appointed by the
Secretary-General.
In the new resolution, the Council calls on
Committee members to make every effort to provide
their reasons when objecting to a de-listing request. It
also directs the ombudsperson to forward to petitioners
all information about a negative decision provided by
the Committee, including explanatory comments.
Furthermore, it instructs the Committee to conduct a
comprehensive review of all pending issues so as to
resolve them, to the extent possible, by the end of
2010. For these and many other reasons, I believe that
resolution 1904 (2009) represents a significant step
forward in improving the fairness and transparency of
the sanctions regime under resolution 1267 (1999), thus
enhancing both its effectiveness and its legitimacy.
My delegation would like to thank the United
States as the main sponsor of the resolution, as well as
the other sponsors and all the members of the Council,
for their strong engagement in this very important
matter. At the same time, special thanks are due to
many other United Nations Member States that have
actively supported this process over many years, in
particular the group of like-minded States and the
friends of the rule of law. I would also like to pay a
special tribute to our Belgian predecessors in the chair
of the 1267 Committee, who paved the way for today’s
decisions.
Much will depend on the practical implementation
of this resolution, especially on the appointment of an
eminent ombudsperson with the highest qualifications
in fields such as law, human rights, counter-terrorism
and sanctions. This is a work in progress. This is a case
where the decision of the Council to remain actively
seized of the matter is of particular significance.
Therefore, my delegation very much hopes that the
Council will continue to show an active interest in the
state of the overall work of the 1267 Committee. To
that end, the biannual reports of the Committee to the
Council can prove to be a very useful instrument.

Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):
Costa Rica voted to adopt Security Council resolution
1904 (2009) because we recognize that collective
measures are effective in preventing and eliminating
threats to peace. However, as is well known, my
delegation has advocated the provision of the necessary
procedural safeguards for including people and entities
on the Consolidated List with the single purpose of
strengthening the regime established by resolution
1267 (1999).
In this context, we are pleased with the
improvements included in the resolution adopted today
concerning the sanctions regime, and we think that this
is a step in the right direction. We trust they will be
rapidly implemented. We are particularly pleased to see
the designation of an ombudsperson, providing for the
possibility of interaction between the person in
question and the Member States and relevant United
Nations bodies. We would have preferred the
ombudsperson to be able to issue recommendations,
but we consider that his or her comments will reflect to
some degree the results of their investigations. We
hope that in the future we will achieve a sufficient
consensus to incorporate new improvements into the
sanctions regime established by this resolution.
For the last few months Costa Rica has worked
with the informal Group of Like-minded Countries:
Belgium, Costa Rica, Denmark, Finland, Germany,
Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland. The Group is pleased with the adoption of
this resolution and expresses its gratitude to the
Security Council for taking this important step, with
the aim of implementing fair and clear procedures for
including people and institutions on the sanctions list
and for withdrawing them, as well as for exceptions
authorized for humanitarian reasons, in accordance
with the outcome document of the World Summit of
2005 (General Assembly resolution 60/1). The Group
acknowledges that the improvements in the legal
procedures serve as an acknowledgement of the
concerns expressed by national and regional courts
regarding the fundamental rights of sanctioned people
and institutions, and that the new procedures adopted
strengthen the sanctions regime.
The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers on my list. The Security Council has
thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of
the item on the agenda. The Council will remain seized
of the matter.
The meeting rose at 10.35 a.m.
