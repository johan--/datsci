The meeting was called to order at 6 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/812, which contains the text of a
draft resolution that has been prepared in the course of
the Council’s prior consultations.
I understand that the Council is ready to proceed
to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1651 (2005).
After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on the Council’s behalf.
“The Security Council welcomes the
commencement in Abuja, Nigeria, of the seventh
round of the African Union (AU)-led inter-
Sudanese peace talks on Darfur, and expresses its
appreciation to the African Union, the
international community and the other donors.
“The Security Council is encouraged by the
active participation of representatives from all
invited groups of the Sudan Liberation
Movement/Army (SLM/A) and the Justice and
Equality Movement (JEM), as well as members
of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, as
part of the Government of National Unity, and
urge their continued cooperation with the African
Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) and with the
United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS).
“The Security Council calls on all parties to
the conflict to fulfil their commitments to
conclude a just and full peace accord without
further delay. The Security Council demands that
all parties refrain from violence and put an end to
atrocities on the ground, especially those
committed against civilians, including women
and children, humanitarian workers and
international peacekeepers.
“The Security Council recalls the demands
on the Government of the Sudan and the rebel
forces, as well as other armed groups, to respect
fully their commitments referred to in its recent
resolutions. The Council demands, in particular,
that the SLM/A, the JEM and the Government of
the Sudan immediately cease violence, comply
with the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement, end
impediments to the peace process and cooperate
fully with the African Union Mission, and that
the Government of the Sudan disarm and control
militias. It further demands that those responsible
for violations of human rights and international
humanitarian law be brought to justice without
delay.
“The Security Council recalls its concern
that the persisting violence in Darfur might
further negatively affect the region, in particular
the security of Chad. It firmly condemns in this
context recent attacks perpetrated by armed
elements within Chad and in particular the attack
on 19 December 2005 on positions of the
Chadian national army in the town of Adré, and
supports efforts to reduce tensions on the border.
“The Council reaffirms its determination to
make full use of existing measures under the
relevant Security Council resolutions on the
Sudan, including holding accountable those
responsible for violence and violations of the
arms embargo, and those who impede the peace
process.
“The Security Council expresses its
gratitude to the African Union and its Mission in
the Sudan for the positive role its forces have
played in reducing violence and promoting the
restoration of order in Darfur.

“The Security Council also appeals to
donors to continue both supporting the crucial
work of AMIS in stemming the violence in this
suffering region and providing critical
humanitarian assistance to millions of war-
afflicted civilians in Darfur and across the border
in Chad.
“In the broader Sudan context, the Security
Council welcomes further progress achieved in
the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement, in particular the signing of the
Constitution for Southern Sudan and the
formation of the Government of Southern
Sudan.”
This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2005/67.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.
