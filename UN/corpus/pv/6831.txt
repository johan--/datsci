The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Sierra Leone
Ninth report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Ofﬁce
in Sierra Leone (S/2012/679)
The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Sierra Leone to participate in this
meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2012/698, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
I wish to draw the attention of members to document
S/2012/679, which contains the ninth report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Integrated
Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Azerbaijan, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Guatemala, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal,
Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
United States of America.
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2065 (2012).
I now give the floor to the representative of Sierra
Leone.
Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): Once again, the
Council has demonstrated its collective determination
to see Sierra Leone succeed. I want to assure Council
members that there is ongoing political will on the part
of the Government, as well as a common will and interest
on the part of ordinary folk, for the country to succeed.
In my view, the threat may lie in the interplay of party
politics, and we urge that no effort be spared to resolve
that issue in the interest of the peace consolidation
process in Sierra Leone. We hope that this will ensure
that the process will gravitate in the direction of moving
the country towards its development goals.
I thank the members of the Council for the
unanimity they have shown in adopting resolution 2065
(2012).
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.10 a.m.
