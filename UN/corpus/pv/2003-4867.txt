The meeting was called to order at 5 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Threats to international peace and security caused
by terrorist acts
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Turkey, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Pamir
(Turkey) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/1106, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs
prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by a show of hands.
In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1516 (2003).
I now give the floor to the representative of
Turkey.
Mr. Pamir (Turkey): The recent attacks in
Istanbul have reopened fresh wounds. Once again, in
the face of the most cowardly and unspeakable acts of
violence, we are confronting the unchanging truth
behind the ugly face of terrorism. We see plainly that
terrorism is a means of oppression directed at the very
existence of human life, civilization and our common
values ‚Äî values distilled from the moment the human
adventure started on Earth. As a nation that had to
suffer for more than a decade through one of the most
blatant forms of this evil scourge, we called most
earnestly for decisive international action and
cooperation, long before it struck all around the world.
Just recently we were more successful in reaching
a broader understanding that we should not distinguish
between the motivations, forms and so-called causes of
terrorism. However, I cannot say that we have been as
successful in showing the same sensitivity in not
making a distinction between the victims of terrorism. I
cannot stress enough that we must all avoid falling into
that trap. Just as there are no good terrorists, there are
no second-class victims. All terrorists, therefore,
deserve to be treated in the same manner; so do the
victims of terrorism. A selective approach will prove to
be the wrong way to proceed, as terrorism has always
turned eventually against the very hands that have fed,
abetted or condoned it.
Finally, as the representative of the host nation, I
extend my condolences to my British colleague. I thank
those in the Chamber who have expressed their
sympathy. An extensive and thorough investigation is
under way and has already produced more than
circumstantial evidence.
I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for
having convened this meeting to show solidarity with
the aggrieved people of Turkey.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 5.10 p.m.
