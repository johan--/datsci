The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Côte d’Ivoire
Fourth progress report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Operation in
Côte d’Ivoire (S/2005/186)
Letter dated 25 April 2005 from the Permanent
Representative of South Africa to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the
Security Council (S/2005/270)
The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Côte d’Ivoire, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Djangoné-Bi
(Côte d’Ivoire), took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/186, which contains the fourth
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire. Members of the
Council also have before them document S/2005/282,
which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in
the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
I wish to draw the attention of members to
document S/2005/270, containing the text of a letter
dated 25 April 2005 from the Permanent
Representative of South Africa to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:

Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,

agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.
