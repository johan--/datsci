The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Liberia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Barnes
(Liberia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/1001, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
I wish to draw member’s attention to document
S/2006/976, which contains the text of a letter dated
13 December 2006 from the Chairman of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution

report of the Panel of Experts on Liberia.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
