S/PV.4614 (Resumption 2)
The meeting resumed at 2.20 a.m.
The President (spoke in French): As we agreed
in consultations, we shall vote on the draft resolution
on the basis of the English text, which is before us. The
draft resolution will be circulated in blue very shortly,
but I would like to know whether members are
prepared to vote on the basis of the document that is
now before them. I see this is the case.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2002/1063, which contains the text of a
draft resolution presented by Bulgaria, France, Ireland,
Norway and the United Kingdom. It is my
understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to
the vote on the draft resolution before it. If I hear no
objection, I shall now put the draft resolution to the
vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Colombia, France,
Guinea, Ireland, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway,
Russian Federation, Singapore, Syrian Arab
Republic, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland
Abstaining:
United States of America
The President (spoke in French): The result of
the voting is as follows: 14 votes in favour, none
against and 1 abstention. The draft resolution has been
adopted as resolution 1435 (2002).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Cunningham (United States of America):
The resolution that we have adopted this evening was
flawed, in our view, in that it failed to explicitly
condemn the terrorist groups and those who provide
them with political cover, support and safe haven in the
perpetuation of conflict in the Middle East. Those
responsible for killing civilians obstruct the Quartet’s
efforts and the prospects for Palestinian reform. They
are known groups — Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad,
and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. The leaders and
spokesmen of these groups have openly claimed credit
for scores of terrorist bombings and for many deaths
and injuries. Their actions are aimed at the peace
process, at Israelis and at Palestinians.
This Council cannot claim to be seriously
considering efforts in the Middle East unless it is also
willing to recognize the tragic dynamic at play. Each
time a glimmer of hope, however dim, appears, a
terrorist act rises up to extinguish it. What we had
hoped for at this time was for the Council to assume its
responsibilities, take a clear stand against the actions of
these terrorist groups and call for action against them.
This resolution starts that process, but it does not
go far enough. Nor does it provide the clarity and
context we think is required, as set out in the draft text
we ourselves tabled on Monday. Our text was more
explicit on terrorism, those who perpetuate it, the need
to combat it, and on strong support for the Quartet, the
political process and continued effort on the ground in
the region. Because this resolution does not meet that
standard, and because we do not think it as well
conceived or worded as it should be, given the
importance of the issues it addresses, we have
abstained.
The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers on my list. The Security Council has
thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of
the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 2.30 a.m.
