The agenda was adopted.

The President (interpretation from the French): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the situation in Western Sahara,

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1994/352, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs prior
consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following revision to be made to the text
of the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/352,
in its provisional form: the sixth preambular paragraph
should read as follows: "Recalling paragraph 22 of the
Secretary General‚Äôs report (S/1994/283),".
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before
it, as orally revised, in its provisional form. Unless I hear
any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote
now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Djibouti,
France, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Rwanda, Spain, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America
The President (interpretation from the French):
There were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution in its
provisional form, as orally revised, has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 907 (1994).

stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.
