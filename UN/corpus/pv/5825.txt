Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Letter dated 22 November 2006 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security
Council (S/2006/920)
Report of the Secretary-General on the request
of Nepal for United Nations assistance in
support of its peace process (S/2008/5)
The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Nepal, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Acharya
(Nepal) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/34, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2008/5, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the request of Nepal for United
Nations assistance in support of its peace process. I
would like to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to copies of a letter dated 27 December 2007
from the Secretary-General addressed to the President
of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America, Viet
Nam.
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1796 (2008).
I now give the floor to the representative of
Nepal.
Mr. Acharya (Nepal): I am taking the floor to
express my sincere appreciation and thanks to you,
Mr. President, and all the other members of the Council
for your constructive support in the process of adopting
this resolution extending the mandate of the United
Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN). I also take this
opportunity to especially thank the British delegation
for taking pains in drafting and arriving at a consensus
on the resolution.
I also take this opportunity to thank the
Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the
subject (S/2008/5), reflecting the developments on the
ground and developments in the peace process in
Nepal. I also want to express my sincere appreciation
and thanks to the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Ian Martin, for all the work he
has done during the process and to the team of officials
of the Secretariat who have been helping with the
process.
With the adoption of this resolution, I am
confident that during the next six months Nepal will be
able to achieve progress in the peace process, including
the holding of Constituent Assembly election in April
2008. I want to assure you, Sir, and the other members
of the Council that Nepal will fully cooperate with the
Special Representative and UNMIN in implementing
the mandate that has been adopted.
The President (spoke in Arabic): There are no
further speakers on my list. The Security Council has
thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of
the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
