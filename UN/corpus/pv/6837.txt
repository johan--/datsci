The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Somalia
Report of the Secretary-General on Somalia
(S/2012/643)
The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Somalia to participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2012/643, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on Somalia.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2012/708, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by France, Germany, Italy, Morocco,
Portugal, South Africa and the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Azerbaijan, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Guatemala, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal,
Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2067 (2012).
I now give the floor to the representative of Somalia.
Mr. Duale (Somalia): I am very happy that the
resolution that the Security Council has just adopted
is the result of all the efforts that the Council has made
in the past in trying to forge the way for Somalia to
achieve a more permanent type of Government. It has
been 21 years since we lost most of our sovereignty and
our share in the international community’s endeavour
for peace and security.
Today’s resolution is a landmark and augurs well
for our Government and the future of Somalia and for
the new President to forge ahead towards peace and
security.
The new Government’s achievement of this
stage not only augurs well for the security of the
region but will also help the fight against piracy off
the coast of Somalia. We are therefore very grateful
to the international community, the United Nations
and especially our neighbours and the African Union
Mission in Somalia, which have helped our transitional
Government fight against Al-Shabaab, who are allied
with Al-Qaida.
However, the Council will recognize that the real
fight is just starting — the fight for a real nation to
emerge from the ruins of destruction to a nationhood
that will allow every Somali to be proud of being from
that country. I hope that the Security Council, the
international community and the United Nations will
continue with their efforts to sustain the progress and
independence of Somalia so as to truly reach the goals
that we all hope will be achieved in the near future.
This Government now has four years, and we hope
that in those four years at least the structures that have
been destroyed and the Government machinery that is
not functioning can be put in place as soon as possible.
From there on, we hope there will be independent
elections in which every person will vote personally,
not through selection or through criminal influences.
I feel very emotional. I am so excited that I cannot
find the appropriate words to express our happiness and
that of all Somalis, be they in Somalia or in the diaspora.
I hope that that happiness is also shared by the members
of the Security Council, who have endeavoured, for the
past 21 years, to reach at least this stage of possibility
of looking forward.
The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
