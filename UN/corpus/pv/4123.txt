The agenda was adopted.
The situation between Iraq and Kuwait
Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to
paragraphs 28 and 30 of resolution 1284 (1999) and
paragraph 5 of resolution 1281 (1999) (S/2000/208)
The President: The Security Council will now resume
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraphs 28 and 30
of resolution 1284 (1999) and paragraph 5 of resolution
1281 (1999), document S/2000/208.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2000/266, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/2000/266)
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1293 (2000).
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
Before adjourning the meeting, I should like to note
that this is the last formal meeting to take place under the
current presidency of Bangladesh. I take this opportunity
formally to thank everyone, and particularly the support
services — the Secretariat, the interpreters and the
summary writers. They have been very, very supportive
and helpful. I extend to all of them sincere thanks from
my side and from my team.
The meeting rose at 10.50 a.m.
