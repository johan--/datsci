The meeting was called to order at 10.40 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation concerning Western Sahara
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation concerning Western Sahara
(S/2011/249)
The President (spoke in Spanish): Under rule 37
of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of Spain to participate in this
meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/268, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, the Russian
Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of
America.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2011/249, containing the report of the
Secretary-General on the situation concerning Western
Sahara.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): On this day, 27 April,
17 years ago, South Africans loudly proclaimed from
their rooftops, in the words of Doctor Martin Luther
King Jr.: “Free at last! Free at last!” This was in
celebration of the fulfilment of our right to
self-determination and freedom. Nelson Mandela stated
that our freedom would be incomplete without the
freedom and self-determination of others. The people
of Western Sahara continue to be denied this
inalienable right.
Twenty years ago, this Council mandated the
creation of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). While
MINURSO has successfully maintained the ceasefire,
its core mandate of overseeing the referendum that
would lead to the realization of the right to self-
determination of the people of Western Sahara has not
been realized.
We welcome the fact that the parties have made
some progress during their negotiations, especially on
confidence-building measures. However, we regret that
the parties have not moved on the core issues that
would allow the people of Western Sahara to freely
determine their future and destiny, whether it is full
independence or autonomy from Morocco.
It is noteworthy that the Council, through the
draft resolution before us (S/2011/268), encourages the
parties to demonstrate further political will towards a
solution, including by expanding on their discussions
of each other’s proposals. We would hope that a
meaningful engagement in this manner would
contribute to finding a mutually acceptable solution
that would provide for the self-determination of the
people of Western Sahara.
My delegation further welcomes the parties’
stated commitment to hold the seventh round of
informal talks in May to examine the 27 April 2007
proposals. We urge them to focus on the core issues in
order to bring finality to this intractable dispute.
The impending adoption of this draft resolution
comes at a critical time in history, when the people of
the Middle East and North Africa are demanding the
full promotion, protection and enjoyment of their
political, socio-economic and human rights. Our
discussion on the situation in the Western Sahara also
comes at a time when the Security Council acted
swiftly in fulfilling its mandate to maintain
international peace and security in Libya and Côte
d’Ivoire, as well as ensuring that the voices of the
people in those countries were heard. As a responsible
member of the Council, we supported those actions.
Uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa are an
indication that the status quo, when the human rights of
people are denied, can no longer be sustained.
In keeping with the Council’s action in the past
few months, we have to ensure that the rights of the
people of Western Sahara are not ignored and are
protected. Human rights are universal, indivisible and
interdependent. It is a travesty that MINURSO’s is one
of the few United Nations mandates, and the only one
in Africa, that does not include a human rights
mandate. This double standard creates the impression
that the Security Council does not care about the
S/PV.6523
311-31280
human rights of the people of Western Sahara.
Certainly, the continued inertia of the Council on this
matter has the potential to erode the credibility of this
important body. South Africa maintains that
MINURSO should have a human rights monitoring
mandate, especially in the light of recent reports of
human rights incidents in Western Sahara, including
events in Laayoune late last year.
The draft resolution that we have before us
stresses the importance of improving the human rights
situation in Western Sahara in the Tindouf camps and
encourages the parties to work with the international
community to develop and implement independent and
credible measures to ensure full respect for human
rights, bearing in mind their relevant obligations under
international law. We would have hoped that the
Council would have created a mechanism to protect the
human rights of the Saharawi people, as it does in other
situations. We believe that an international, credible,
legal and permanent mechanism is necessary.
We note the establishment of the National
Council on Human Rights in Morocco and the
proposed component regarding the territory of Western
Sahara, as well as the commitment of Morocco to
ensure unqualified and unimpeded access to all special
procedures of the United Nations Human Rights
Council. However, we believe that this should be done
without prejudice to the legal status of Western Sahara
as a Non-Self-Governing Territory under Chapter XI of
the Charter of the United Nations.
In conclusion, we draw attention to the fact that
Western Sahara remains the last colony on the African
continent and that it is listed as a Non-Self-Governing
Territory by the United Nations. South Africa will
continue to support efforts to achieve a just, lasting and
mutually acceptable political solution, which will
provide for the inalienable right to self-determination
of the people of Western Sahara. It is for this reason
that my delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before us, extending the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara.
Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): At its 2984th meeting,
on 29 April 1991, the Security Council, through
resolution 690 (1991), established the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO). Central to the Mission’s mandate is a
referendum in Western Sahara as part of a peaceful
settlement of an intractable problem. In essence,
MINURSO derives its legal basis and relevance from
that resolution. We are deeply troubled by the lack of a
reference to resolution 690 (1991) in the current draft
resolution (S/2011/268).
Paragraph 120 of the Secretary-General’s report
(S/2011/249) reinforces the point that the decision of
the fate of Western Sahara lies with the people of the
territory. The Security Council has supported this
principle through its positions on South Sudan and,
now, in North Africa. The people of Western Sahara
must be given a similar opportunity to determine their
own destiny. Indeed, the ongoing developments in the
Middle East and North Africa are a strong reminder
that the status quo is no longer tenable.
All Members of the United Nations have
emphasized the need for coherence and consistency in
the policies we promote. In 2005, human rights
received a major boost with the establishment of the
Human Rights Council. Collectively, Member States
reaffirmed their commitment and obligation to promote
universal respect for and observance and protection of
all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all in
accordance with the United Nations Charter. That is
even more so in cases where parties to conflict accuse
each other of rights violations. The intolerable human
rights violations in Western Sahara require constant
monitoring and appropriate rapid-response capability,
which only a permanent and neutral international
human rights monitoring and reporting body could
provide.
Nigeria is convinced of the importance of
upholding human rights as a universal principle. The
Council should be seen to promote and vigorously
defend human rights in all circumstances. The
Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, a full-fledged
member of the African Union (AU) since 1984,
remains the only country on the continent still awaiting
the completion of its process of decolonization. It is
inconceivable that neither the African Union nor a
member State of the AU is a member of the Group of
Friends of Western Sahara. We believe that the time
has come to involve African Union countries in the
efforts to find an international solution to the conflict.
Nobody could be better friends of the people of
Western Sahara than the representatives of the regional
group to which it belongs.

11-312804
My delegation will vote for this draft resolution,
but we hope that, in the future, some of the concerns
we have raised will be considered.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
other speakers inscribed on my list of those wishing to
speak before the voting on the draft resolution. I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America.
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1979 (2011).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): It has
been 20 years since the Council first mandated the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO). As the Secretary-General notes in
his report (S/2011/249), the situation on the ground has
changed dramatically in those 20 years. For the United
Kingdom, the status quo is unsustainable in the longer
term. If the Security Council does not work actively to
resolve this issue, it will get worse.
We support the tireless efforts of Ambassador
Christopher Ross, but it is clear that no progress has
been made on the substance of the dispute. This
stalemate is regrettable, and we should not pretend
otherwise.
The United Kingdom wants to see greater
efficiency in all peacekeeping missions. We approach
MINURSO no differently. This resolution requests the
Secretary-General to keep MINURSO’s operations
under close review and to pursue a rigorous and
strategic approach to its deployment, and calls for an
examination of the existing challenges to MINURSO’s
operations to reflect more closely the situation on the
ground.
The core issue under dispute in relation to
Western Sahara is one of territory and sovereignty. This
resolution does not affect the position of the parties in
that respect. But the human rights situation in Western
Sahara and the Tindouf camps is frequently raised by
both parties and is an important issue in itself. The
United Kingdom has said for a number of years that the
Security Council should address this matter. We are
pleased that it has now done so in this resolution. The
Council has welcomed Morocco’s proposals and those
of the Frente Polisario as a meaningful step forward on
human rights, but has also set expectations for
implementation, delivery and further progress.
The political future of Western Sahara will be
determined only by a concerted effort from both
Morocco and the Polisario, with the support of the
international community. Each party must demonstrate
political will towards a solution by expanding upon
their discussions of the other’s proposals and
considering innovative approaches to the negotiations.
Unless and until the political will can be found by the
parties, we will be no closer to the realization of a
substantive political solution.
Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): My
delegation welcomes the Security Council’s unanimous
adoption of resolution 1979 (2011), which highlights
the importance attached by the international
community to settling the conflict in Western Sahara.
The resolution sends three important messages.
First, it recalls the priority nature of the political
process. We welcome the acceleration of unofficial
talks under the auspices of the Personal Envoy of the
Secretary-General, and hope that official negotiations
will quickly resume. We support the initiatives taken
by Mr. Ross along these lines, but he will be able to do
nothing without the commitment of all parties, which
should participate in the negotiations, as recalled by
the resolution we have just adopted. The parties should
show a sense of realism and a spirit of compromise,
and abstain from any provocation.
The settlement of this question is a necessity not
only for the people of Western Sahara, but also for the
stability, security and integration of the Maghreb
region. Nothing should therefore distract us from this
objective. In this regard, Morocco has presented a
serious and credible autonomy plan that is a good basis
for negotiation.
The second message is that the resolution sends a
clear message of support for the reforms undertaken by
Morocco, especially with respect to human rights. The
King of Morocco, in his historic 9 March speech,
S/PV.6523
511-31280
launched a reform movement that the Council wishes
to support. In this context, we are pleased that Morocco
has decided not only to establish national human rights
mechanisms, but also to ensure access to the 33 special
procedures of the Human Rights Council. The Security
Council has welcomed and encouraged these new
substantial measures, which will benefit the population
of Western Sahara in particular. But the resolution also
recalls that the situation of the Sahrawi population in
the Tindouf camps should not be forgotten.
The third message is that the resolution highlights
the considerable progress being made in the area of
confidence-building measures. The agreement of the
parties and the neighbouring States to meet regularly
with the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to reassess the
entire confidence-building programme is important.
Last week, the dispatch of a team to study the
construction of a road that would facilitate family
visits and the organization of a seminar in Portugal
between Sahrawis in Western Sahara and in the camps
are positive developments. Every effort must be made
to alleviate the day-to-day difficulties of the Sahrawi
population. We salute the role played by the UNHCR
in this regard. We support any additional measures
taken on the political and humanitarian levels, with the
agreement of the parties, to promote mutual trust.
Mr. Messone (Gabon) (spoke in French):
Gabon’s position on the issue of Western Sahara is well
known. We have always backed dialogue among the
parties and positions mindful of international law and
regional stability. We wish to recall our commitment to
respect for human rights.
My delegation welcomes the adoption of today’s
resolution 1979 (2011) on Western Sahara. This
balanced resolution confirms the importance of the
negotiating process and reiterates the Council’s
appreciation for the efforts undertaken by Morocco
since 2006. Gabon also welcomes the resolution’s
support for the three initiatives proposed by the
Secretary-General in his report (S/2011/249). These
initiatives will promote a deepening of the negotiations
under way under the aegis of the Secretary-General’s
Personal Envoy, Mr. Christopher Ross, to whom we
reiterate our support for his efforts to reinvigorate the
negotiating process.
We believe that the resolution also endorses the
Secretary-General’s recommendation as to the need for
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees to continue to address the issue of
refugees in the Tindouf camps. We welcome the
recognition of the efforts and measures undertaken by
Morocco to consolidate and strengthen the promotion
and protection of human rights, especially in Western
Sahara. Gabon remains wedded to the main objective
of promoting a definitive solution to this problem and
to creating conditions conducive to stability in the
Maghreb region.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the current stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 11 a.m.
