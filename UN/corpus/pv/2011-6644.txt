The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Libya
The President: Under rule 37 of the Security
Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Libya to participate in this meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/670, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Nigeria, Portugal,
the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2017 (2011).
I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the vote.
Mr. Wittig (Germany): Germany voted in favour
of the resolution just adopted by this Council,
resolution 2017 (2011).
We appreciate the initiative of the Russian
Federation for taking up this important issue. The
proliferation of all arms and related material of all
types from Libya to the region is an issue of utmost
concern to all of us. Resolution 2017 (2011) rightly
addresses man-portable air defence systems
(MANPADS) and other small arms and light weapons,
chemical weapons and materiel of all types.
It is our understanding that the latter reference
covers nuclear and radiological materiel, and we
believe that the International Atomic Energy Agency,
like the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, should have a crucial role to play in this
regard. In this context, Germany is planning to give
technical support to a mission of inspectors of the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
to Libya. Germany is also closely cooperating with
partners on how to secure MANPADS and other small
arms and light weapons.
In paragraph 5, resolution 2017 (2011) stipulates
a reporting mechanism on the assessment of the threats
and challenges posed by the proliferation of all arms
and related materiel of all types. The Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011), with
assistance from its Panel of Experts, is requested to
submit a report to the Council in this regard.
As is well known, Germany is of the view that, as
a matter of principle, independent panels of experts
should report directly to the Council. Most of the
panels of experts established by the Council, including
that established under resolution 1973 (2011) and
referred to in paragraph 5 of today‚Äôs resolution, report
directly to the Council. In order to preserve their
independence, panels of experts should not be
requested to report through committees. The
independent expertise of the panels should be leant
directly to the decision-makers in the Council without
being subject to pre-examination by subsidiary organs.
Germany would have preferred a reporting mechanism
under today‚Äôs resolution that would have allowed the
Panel of Experts to report directly to the Council.
Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The principal aim of resolution 2017 (2011),
drafted by the Russian Federation and adopted today, is
to curb the uncontrolled proliferation of weapons of all
kinds and related materiel as a result of the Libyan
conflict. Any serious breach of the arms embargo
imposed by the Security Council is likely to destabilize
the entire region. The Libyan authorities must assume
the main responsibility for this task, but it is clear that
an effective resolution of the problem will require the
constructive cooperation of Libya‚Äôs neighbours and the
international community as a whole. We are convinced
that consolidated efforts in this area would be in the
interest of all.

In drafting the resolution, we could not fail bear
in mind the great threat posed by Libyan weapons, in
particular man-portable air defence systems, falling
into the hands of terrorist groups that are highly active
in the region. In that regard, civil aviation is equally at
risk. That is why the resolution assigns an active role
to the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive
Directorate and the International Civil Aviation
Organization.
We welcome the consensus adoption of resolution
2017 (2011).
The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 3.15 p.m.
