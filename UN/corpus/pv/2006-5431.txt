The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation concerning Western Sahara
Report of the Secretary-General on the
situation concerning Western Sahara
(S/2006/249)
The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/249, containing the report of the
Secretary-General on the situation concerning Western
Sahara. Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/268, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Spain, the
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the
United States.
I wish to draw the attention of members to
documents S/2006/258 and S/2006/266, containing the
texts of letters dated 24 and 26 April 2006,
respectively, from the Permanent Representatives of
Algeria and Namibia addressed to the President of the
Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America
The President (spoke in Chinese): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1675 (2006).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Bolton (United States of America): The
United States voted in favour of the resolution in the
hope that parties will use the next six months to make
real progress towards reaching a mutually acceptable
solution that brings peace, stability and economic
prosperity to the region in a manner consistent with the
principle of self-determination for the people of
Western Sahara.
We recognize the important role of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
in those efforts, but we must continually monitor the
ability of the Mission to carry out its mandated tasks,
taking into account limited peacekeeping resources.
The United States looks forward to the next
report of the Secretary-General prior to the end of the
current mandate period, and hopes that the parties will
have begun to take meaningful steps towards a final
resolution of the dispute.
The settlement of the Western Sahara conflict
would enhance the stability and economic prosperity of
the Maghreb. Unresolved, the conflict and
humanitarian crisis continue to be the primary
impediments to regional integration and development.
The United States cannot impose a solution, but
together we can continue to urge the parties to work
together and with the United Nations in a spirit of
flexibility and compromise. Morocco has
expressed its intention to put forward an autonomy
plan for the territory, and we encourage it to submit a
plan that is at once strong and credible in the hope that
it might form the basis of a new United Nations-led
negotiating process.
Our hope over the next six months is simple, but,
we hope, not too ambitious. It is that we will see
significant progress towards launching a diplomatic
effort that will allow the parties to move beyond the
status quo in the direction of a final resolution of a
dispute that has already gone on too long.
Mr. Johnston (United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland): The United Kingdom voted in
favour of the resolution just adopted by the Council to
renew the mandate of the United Nations Mission for
the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for a
further six months.
3
S/PV.5431
Since the resolution is a technical rollover of the
mandate and does not respond to any other
recommendations made in the Secretary-General‚Äôs
report this month, we would like to set out some
aspects of the situation which we consider to be
particularly important.
We would like to commend MINURSO for its
ongoing stabilization and ceasefire monitoring role,
and for its efforts at restructuring. We would also like
to thank Mr. Van Walsum, the Secretary-General‚Äôs
Personal Envoy, for his efforts to find a way forward in
the dispute.
The United Kingdom believes that the approach
outlined in the Secretary-General‚Äôs report ‚Äî that of
direct negotiations without preconditions ‚Äî offers a
way to move beyond the current impasse. The United
Kingdom notes the references in the report to the
human rights situation and remains concerned by that
situation. The United Kingdom fully supports the
intention of the Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights to send a delegation to the region.
The United Kingdom hopes that there will be
progress beyond the current impasse before the next
mandate renewal in October, and that there will
therefore not need to be another simply technical
rollover. We take this opportunity to stress again that
any solution has to be mutually acceptable, in line with
United Nations requirements as set out in previous
Security Council resolutions.
Mr. Faaborg-Andersen (Denmark): Denmark
has just voted in favour of resolution 1675 (2006)
extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for
an additional six months. Having done so, we would
like to add our appreciation for the efforts of the
Secretary-General, his Personal Envoy, Ambassador
van Walsum, and the MINURSO operation, for their
work towards finding a resolution to the protracted
conflict in Western Sahara.
Maintaining the status quo is not a viable option;
carries with it the high risk of a renewed outbreak of
hostilities, and it thus needs to be emphasized that all
parties concerned must engage in renewed dialogue
and negotiations in order to move beyond the current
impasse. Denmark would welcome any sincere and
well-conceived initiative that could move the issue
towards a mutually acceptable solution. We appreciate
the very difficult task of the Personal Envoy and would
like to voice our full support for his continued efforts
towards bringing about a peaceful resolution to the
conflict.
We thank the Secretary-General for his recent
report on the situation in Western Sahara (S/2006/249).
In that context, we would like to reiterate Denmark‚Äôs
firm and long-standing position on the need for full
respect for human rights. We welcome the plans of the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights to send a mission to the region, and we
look forward to receiving its report.
Mr. Kitaoka (Japan): Japan voted in favour of,
and welcomes the adoption of, the resolution on
Western Sahara, which extends the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara for another six months. Given the importance of
the role that the Secretary-General and his Personal
Envoy are playing in the search for a peaceful solution
to this issue, Japan welcomes their efforts and will
continue to support them.
Mr. Garc√≠a Morit√°n (Argentina) (spoke in
Spanish): Argentina voted in favour of the resolution
extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for
a period of six months, because we understand that the
presence of the Mission in Western Sahara continues to
be necessary.
My delegation believes that the Security Council
must send a clear message to the parties that they must
endeavour to find a peaceful resolution to this long-
standing dispute. In that connection, we hope that the
next six months will be used positively to address the
stagnant situation we have seen in recent years. We are
convinced that, as in other disputes and conflicts on the
agenda of the United Nations, negotiations and
dialogue constitute the best way to find a definitive
solution in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations and the relevant resolutions adopted by the
Security Council and other bodies of the Organization.
In that context, I would like to reiterate my
country‚Äôs support for the work of Mr. Peter van
Walsum, Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General. We
thank him for his efforts in recent months and ask him
to continue to work to overcome the current impasse.
Lastly, I would like to stress that the report of the
Secretary-General (S/2006/249) expresses concern at
the worsening of the human rights situation in the
4
S/PV.5431
territory. We hope that the mission by the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
will be able to undertake its visit in mid-May in order
to investigate the situation and prepare a report.
Given the importance that Argentina attaches to
the protection of human rights, we will continue to
follow closely the developments in this area. My
delegation hopes that these matters will be taken into
consideration by the Council when it takes up the next
renewal of MINURSO‚Äôs mandate, in October 2006.
Mr. De Rivi√®re (France) (spoke in French): The
Security Council has just renewed the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) for an additional six months. That
was a good decision, for the United Nations Mission
continues to play a useful and stabilizing role.
France hopes that the coming months will be used
to the best advantage by the parties and the States of
the region to resume the path of dialogue and to find a
mutually acceptable political solution. In that regard,
the announcement by the Kingdom of Morocco
regarding future proposals is an important and
encouraging development.
Like the Secretary-General and his Personal
Envoy, to whom we reiterate our support, we believe
that direct negotiations offer the only credible prospect
for finding a way out of the impasse.
Lastly, we welcome the upcoming visit by a
mission of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights. We call on all the
parties concerned to welcome it properly.
Mr. Burian (Slovakia): Slovakia too voted in
favour of the technical resolution extending the
mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara for six more months.
We hope that this period will be used to resume
dialogue between the parties to find a final solution to
the issue of Western Sahara based on direct
negotiations. We also agree that adequate attention
should be paid to the human rights situation in the area.
Mr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania):
The United Republic of Tanzania voted in favour of the
resolution extending the mandate of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.
However, it is our view that the right of self-
determination of the people of Western Sahara cannot
be subject to any preconditions. As it is, it has gone
unfulfilled for far too long. It is our hope that the next
six months will witness real progress towards the
realization of that right.
The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.30 a.m.
