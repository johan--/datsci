The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Liberia, in which she requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Osode
(Liberia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/742, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council’s
prior consultations.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2007/689, which contains the text of a
letter dated 5 December 2007 from the Chairman of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia addressed to
the President of the Security Council transmitting the
report of the Panel of Experts on Liberia.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, China, Congo, France, Ghana,
Indonesia, Italy, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Russian

Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
