Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation concerning Rwanda
Second progress report of the Secretary-General on
the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-
Rwanda (UNOMUR) (S/1994/715)
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the second
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR),
document S/1994/715.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/1994/723, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following revision to be made to the text
of the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/723 in
its provisional form. Operative paragraph 3 should read as
follows:
"Requests the Secretary-General to report to the
Council on the termination of UNOMUR before the
completion of its mandate".
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/1994/691, which contains the
text of a letter dated 8 June 1994 from the Permanent
Representative of Rwanda to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it, as orally
revised in its provisional form. Unless I hear any
objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Djibouti,
France, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Rwanda, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution, as orally revised in its provisional
form, has been adopted unanimously as resolution 928
(1994).
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 1.55 p.m.
