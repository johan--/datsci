The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Côte d’Ivoire
Letter dated 11 May 2011 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the President
of the Security Council (S/2011/297)
The President (spoke in French): Unless I hear
any objection, under rule 37 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure I invite the
representative of Côte d’Ivoire to participate in this
meeting.
It is so decided.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/299, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France and Lebanon.
I wish to also draw the attention of Council
members to documents S/2011/297 and S/2011/295,
containing letters from the Secretary-General dated
11 May 2011 and 9 May 2011, respectively.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall first call on members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
Ms. Rice (United States of America): The United
States will support the draft resolution that is before us,
but we would like to highlight an important point. The
aviation assets on loan to the United Nations Operation
in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) will be returned to the
United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) no later
than 30 June, pursuant to the draft resolution, in order
to avoid destabilizing Liberia. We applaud the efforts
of UNMIL’s peacekeepers to continue to fulfil their
duties, despite having fewer assets — a sacrifice they
generously made, and which we all deemed necessary,
to assist UNOCI in a time of need.
Now, as Côte d’Ivoire begins to emerge from its
crisis, we must not lose focus on Liberia. As Liberia
enters its electoral season, with a referendum in August
and a presidential election this fall, UNMIL must be
fully equipped. We, as a Council, decided that UNMIL
required specific assets to fulfil its mandate, and we
must honour our commitment to ensuring that it has the
tools on hand to do its job.
The United States has promised to support clear,
credible and achievable mandates that are fully
resourced and equipped. We must not jeopardize
Liberia’s fragile peace even as we continue to work to
consolidate the progress that we have seen of late in
Côte d’Ivoire. This will be the last extension of the
loan of UNMIL’s assets that the United States will
support, barring any unforeseen circumstances.
The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my national capacity.
As the Secretary-General recalls in his most
recent letters to the Security Council, the Council’s
priority task is to stabilize Côte d’Ivoire.
Reinforcements to Côte d’Ivoire of military helicopters
attached to the United Nations Mission in Liberia
(UNMIL) play an essential role in this. The main
threats of subregional destabilization are now in Côte
d’Ivoire. It is not the Council’s job to interfere in the
management of logistical peacekeeping assets by the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The Council
has always supported UNMIL, which should continue
to enjoy the resources it needs in the context of the
democratic transition that began four years ago
following the end of a 10-year crisis. In that spirit, on
15 June the Security Council must seize the
opportunity and modalities for cooperation between
UNMIL and the United Nations Operation in Côte
d’Ivoire.
I resume my functions as President of the
Council.
I shall now put the draft resolution to the vote.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and United States of
America.
The President (spoke in French): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1981 (2011).
I call on the representative of Côte d’Ivoire.
S/PV.6535
311-33665
Mr. Bamba (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French):
Like all States represented here, Côte d’Ivoire
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 1981
(2001). My delegation stresses that Côte d’Ivoire is in
transition and gradually emerging from the recent
crisis. The security situation remains volatile,
particularly in the western part of the country, and must
be strengthened. We call on the Security Council to act
pragmatically and flexibly in allocating resources,
particularly military.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council
will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
