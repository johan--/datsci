Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Admission of new Members
Report of the Committee on the Admission of
New Members concerning the application of the
Democratic Republic of East Timor for
admission to membership in the United Nations
(S/2002/566)
The President: Under the item on its agenda, the
Security Council will now begin its consideration of
the report of the Committee on the Admission of New
Members concerning the application of the Democratic
Republic of East Timor for admission to membership
in the United Nations. The report appears as document
S/2002/566.
In paragraph 3 of the report, the Committee
recommends to the Security Council the adoption of a
draft resolution on the application of the Democratic
Republic of East Timor for admission to membership
in the United Nations. I should like to congratulate the
Committee on its unanimous decision to recommend
that the Democratic Republic of East Timor be
admitted to membership in the United Nations.
In accordance with the understanding reached in
prior consultations among members of the Council, I
propose that the Council adopt the draft resolution
contained in paragraph 3 of the report of the
Committee on the Admission of New Members without
a vote.
As I see no objection, it is so decided.
I therefore declare that the draft resolution
contained in paragraph 3 of the report of the
Committee on the Admission of New Members
(S/2002/566) has been adopted without a vote as
resolution 1414 (2002).
I shall convey the decision of the Security
Council recommending the admission of the
Democratic Republic of East Timor to membership in
the United Nations to the Secretary-General for
transmittal to the fifty-seventh session of the General
Assembly in accordance with rule 60 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure and the request of the
Democratic Republic of East Timor.
I shall now make a statement, in my capacity as
President of the Security Council, on behalf of the
members of the Council.
“The Security Council has decided to
recommend to the General Assembly that the
Democratic Republic of East Timor be admitted
as a Member of the United Nations. On behalf of
the members of the Council, I wish to extend my
congratulations to the Democratic Republic of
East Timor on this historic occasion.
“The Council notes with great satisfaction
the Democratic Republic of East Timor’s solemn
commitment to uphold the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations
and to fulfil all the obligations contained therein.
“We look forward to the day in the near
future when the Democratic Republic of East
Timor will join us as a Member of the United
Nations and to working closely with its
representatives.”
This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2002/15.
The Council has thus concluded its consideration
of the matter before it.
The meeting rose at 1.45 p.m.
