The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
Report of the Secretary-General on the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur (S/2013/420)
The President: In accordance with rule 37 of
the Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of the Sudan to participate in this
meeting.
The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/2013/448, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Rwanda, Togo and the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2013/420, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, China, France,
Guatemala, Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan,
Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda,
Togo, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2113 (2013).
I now give the floor to the representative of the
Sudan.
Mr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset,
I should like to thank all members of the Council for
their cooperation in drafting resolution 2113 (2013).
We welcome the renewal of the mandate of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID), in accordance with resolution 1769 (2007),
under which it was established. We also reaffirm the
importance of coordinating and discussing these issues
with the Government of the Sudan in order to consider
all measures undertaken towards the renewal of the
mandate. In that regard, I refer in particular to the
review provided for in paragraph 3 of the resolution,
to be conducted in close consultation with the African
Union and the Secretary-General, who is requested to
present his recommendations in February 2014.
I reaffirm the report‚Äôs conclusion that the situation
in Darfur has improved since UNAMID was launched.
We echo the Security Council‚Äôs concern over the failure
of certain parties to sign the peace agreement. All
direct and indirect support for those movements must
be halted.
As for the crimes that have been committed in
Darfur, we welcome the investigations undertaken
by the Special Prosecutor, and commend the Security
Council for encouraging that process. We also welcome
the Council‚Äôs support for the Doha Document for Peace
in Darfur, and commend its refusal to accept the lack
of support on the part of certain parties to the peace
agreement and its insistence that those movements end
their hostilities.
The Security Council has condemned every
act of violence in Darfur. We support in particular
its condemnation of the assassination of Mohamed
Bashar, as well as the unfortunate incident in which
seven Tanzanian soldiers lost their lives. We reiterate
our condolences and our willingness to work with the
Security Council to pursue our investigations and arrest
those responsible. The attack was merely an attempt to
undermine the Darfur peace process. We reiterate the
principled position of the Government of the Sudan that
a solution to the conflict cannot be found other than
through negotiations and the peace process, which the
rebel attacks on UNAMID are attempts to forestall.
We hope that the Security Council will help the
Government of the Sudan in its ongoing efforts to
achieve peace, security and stability in my country.
The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
