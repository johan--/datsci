Security Council 3899th meeting
Fifty-third year 29 June 1998
The meeting was called to order at 6.25 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Angola
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (S/1998/524)
The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Angola and Mali in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council’s
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules
of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Van Dunem
“Mbinda” (Angola) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Ag Oumar (Mali) took the seat reserved for him
at the side of the Council Chamber.
The President: I give the floor to the Deputy
Secretary-General.
The Deputy Secretary-General: We have gathered
this evening to mourn irreplaceable colleagues. Maître
Alioune Blondin Beye and seven members of his team paid
the highest price possible for peace in Angola. We are here
to remember them all: Maître Beye, Koffi Adjoyi,
Beadengar Dessande, Amadou Moctar Gueye, Ibikunle
Williams, Alvaro Costa, Jason Hunter and Andrew
McCurrach. But we are also here to pray that their mission
of peace was not in vain.
Warm, tenacious, full of energy, full of enthusiasm,
Maître Beye was a man totally dedicated to his Mission in
Angola, a Mission which he had nursed since its inception
five years ago.
He literally gave the Mission all the hours God gave
him. He would regularly telephone Headquarters at 2 a.m.
his time. He would spend seven hours in one session
negotiating with one side. If — as happened more than
once — one of the parties chose to break an impasse in
negotiations by introducing a new document at 11.30 p.m.
on a Saturday night, Maître Beye would not wait until the
next morning. Everybody would get to work there and
then.
There would always be those who said the Mission
was not making enough progress — that the Lusaka
Protocol should have been implemented in full by now.
To them, Maître Beye would simply recall the alternative:
that when the process started, Angola’s war took more
than 1,000 lives every day.
It was the cruellest of ironies that death took Maître
Beye at a time when he had just fully recovered from
extensive heart surgery; when he was looking forward to
a well-earned vacation this summer; when he was
contemplating the time he could rightly look back upon
his work as a duty accomplished.
His legacy and his name will live on in Angola.
Recently, he used the funds of a prize awarded to him by
Germany to endow a school in Malange province. The
school now bears his name.
Those who knew him well will remember his
favourite phrase when things were going well — his
trademark, if you like: “On va boucler” — “We’re going
to wrap it up”.
Let that optimism become his legacy. No one can
replace Maître Beye, but his work can and must be
carried on. There could be no more fitting conclusion to
his life than a timely completion of the Lusaka
Protocol — a realization of his dream of a reconciled
Angola. The suffering has gone on long enough, the
hopes have been vanquished too many times. Today, I
hope the parties in Angola will join us in humanity’s
greatest prayer: that which asks not for victory but for
peace.
Expression of sympathy in connection with the deaths
of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
for Angola and his colleagues in the United Nations
Observer Mission in Angola
The President: Council members express their
deepest condolences to the family of Maître Alioune
Blondin Beye, the Secretary-General’s Special
Representative for Angola, and to the families of the
colleagues and crew who were accompanying him: Mr.
Koffi Adjoyi, Mr. Beadengar Dessande, Mr. Moctar

Security Council 3899th meeting
Fifty-third year 29 June 1998
Gueye, Mr. Ibikunle Williams, Captain Alvaro Costa, Mr.
Jason Hunter and Mr. Andrew McCurrach.
The members of the Council also express very deep
condolences to the Governments concerned, namely, the
Governments of Mali, Togo, Chad, Senegal, Nigeria,
Portugal and South Africa.
Over the past several years, the Council has relied on
the wise counsel of Maître Beye in guiding the peace
process in Angola. Maître Beye dedicated himself
wholeheartedly to the cause of peace and maintained his
optimism even under the most adverse circumstances. The
Council expresses its hope that the efforts of this eminent
son of Africa will not have been in vain and that his vision
of a peaceful and prosperous Angola will soon triumph.
I request members to stand and observe a minute of
silence in memory of those who so tragically lost their lives
on 26 June 1998.
The members of the Council observed a minute of
silence.
The President: I give the floor to the representative
of Angola.
Mr. Van Dunem “Mbinda” (Angola): On behalf of
the Government of the Republic of Angola and on my own
behalf, I should like to express our deepest sorrow at the
unexpected death of the African fighter for just causes,
Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, Special Representative of the
Secretary-General of the United Nations for the peace
process in Angola.
The death of Mr. Beye occurred in very sad
circumstances, and at a crucial phase of our peace process.
There is no doubt that it will prove an irreparable loss. His
dedication to the struggle for peace in Angola, once again
demonstrated during his mission to a number of African
countries in search of support for the effective conclusion
of the Lusaka Protocol, was a true testimony to his
humanism and an example of his sacrifice, which were
without precedent in the history of African diplomacy.
During his five years as head of the peace process in
Angola, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye was a dedicated
friend to Angola and to the Angolans. That is why we are
saying here that his death is not only a loss for the peace
process in Angola but also for Africa and for all of
humanity. His sacrifice, his spirit of humanism and his total
dedication even at the most difficult moments — such as
this moment in the peace process in Angola — will stay
in the memory of the Angolan people. At this moment of
grief, on behalf of my Government, we would like to pay
our profound homage to him. To the grieving family, to
the friendly Government of Mali and to the entire United
Nations family, the Mission of Angola to the United
Nations, on behalf of the Angolan Government, transmits
its most profound condolences, which extend also to the
rest of the delegation with which Mr. Beye lost his life.
May his soul rest in peace.
The President: The representative of Mali has asked
for the floor. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
Mr. Ag Oumar (Mali) (interpretation from French):
I wish on behalf of the Government of Mali to thank the
members of the Security Council and the Secretariat staff
for the minute of silence they just observed in memory of
a man who was first and foremost the pride of the people
of Mali and who died as he carried out his mandate.
I grow emotional as I think of how all of Mali feels
this loss. Africa, and the entire world, will also feel the
loss of Maître Beye. The Deputy Secretary-General has
noted that there would always be those who said the
mission was not making enough progress; with Maître
Beye’s sense of optimism, Mali wishes that his work will
indeed be completed, with the determination of all
concerned. He left with optimism, and those who follow
him will inherit the optimism that he always maintained.
I thank the Permanent Representative of Angola for
the condolences he has just expressed. The condolences
are mutual, because Maître Beye viewed Angola as his
second home. It has been said that Maître Beye had no
one work-place; his work-place was wherever he was at
the moment — his bed, his car, his dining table.
It is the wish of the Government of Mali that Maître
Beye’s work for peace should be completed one day. That
would be the greatest tribute that the United Nations
could pay to Maître Beye and to his memory.
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
