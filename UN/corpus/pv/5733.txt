The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Letter dated 2 August 2007 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the
Security Council (S/2007/470)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Israel and Lebanon, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council’s agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the consideration of the item, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council’s
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Gillerman
(Israel) and Mr. Salam (Lebanon) took seats at
the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/506, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, France, Italy,
Peru, Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
Members of the Council also have before them
documents S/2007/392 and S/2007/470, which contain,
respectively, the report of the Secretary-General on the
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and the text
of a letter dated 2 August 2007 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security
Council.
I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2007/396, which contains the
text of a letter dated 29 June 2007 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security
Council, transmitting a letter from the Prime Minister
of Lebanon.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2007/506) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): South Africa
supports the renewal of the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for an
additional year, as recommended by the Secretary-
General and as requested by the Prime Minister of
Lebanon. However, my delegation would have
preferred to have had a draft resolution of a technical
nature. There is no reason to have included in the draft
resolution unrelated sensitive issues which the Council
has on numerous previous occasions commented on in
various resolutions and presidential statements. We are
concerned that these unrelated issues tend to be
selectively chosen from other resolutions and
statements of the past.
While we are not entirely satisfied with all of the
elements of the draft resolution before us, my
delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution
because we continue to believe that UNIFIL has a
positive role to play in bringing about long-term peace
and security in Lebanon.
The President (spoke in French): I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, China, Congo, France, Ghana,
Indonesia, Italy, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1773 (2007).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Lacroix (spoke in French): France is
gratified by the unanimous adoption of resolution 1773
(2007), renewing, unchanged, the mandate of the
S/PV.5733
307-48907
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for
one year, in keeping with the request voiced by the
Government of Lebanon. The decision reflects the full
support of the Security Council for the activities of the
force within the context of its mandate. It also reflects
the international community’s gratitude for the
effectiveness with which UNIFIL is discharging its
mandate in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces.
As the Secretary-General stated in his most recent
report (S/2007/392), UNIFIL has helped to establish a
new strategic military and security environment in
southern Lebanon. That result would not have been
possible without the dedication and valour of the
civilian and military personnel of UNIFIL, to whom
my country wishes to pay tribute. In particular, France
pays tribute to the memory of the soldiers of the
Spanish contingent who were killed on 24 June and the
French demining expert killed while performing his
duties. Those human losses remind us that, despite
improvements in the security situation in southern
Lebanon over the past year, UNIFIL continues to
operate in a difficult and unstable environment.
Under those conditions, it is imperative that
UNIFIL be able to rely on the cooperation of all parties
in order to discharge its mandate. That requires, on the
one hand, pursuing and strengthening mechanisms for
cooperation in the field, including tripartite
arrangements currently in force, which have been
shown to be effective. It also requires the full
implementation by the parties of the Security Council’s
demands as set forth in resolution 1701 (2006) and
reiterated today by the Council, in particular respect
for the cessation of hostilities and for the Blue Line in
its entirety, and respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Lebanon, as well as for its unity
and political independence within its internationally
recognized borders. This also requires progress
towards achieving a lasting ceasefire and a long-term
political solution, as called for by resolution 1701
(2006) and the Council’s 3 August presidential
statement (S/PRST/2007/29).
Finally, I wish to reaffirm the full commitment of
France, side by side with Lebanon and the Lebanese:
its commitment on the ground, with more than 1,600
French soldiers deployed within UNIFIL; and its
political commitment as demonstrated by the resolute
efforts of the French authorities to help the Lebanese
find the path to lasting stability through dialogue with
respect for Lebanese sovereignty and Lebanese
institutions.
Mr. Mantovani (Italy): Allow me to first thank
all delegations for their support of the resolution and
for the relevant and constructive contributions they
made during the negotiations. Today, the Council has
unanimously renewed the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for
another year. That is a major outcome, which
acknowledges the key stabilizing role that the United
Nations mission has played in the region. One year on,
we can say that UNIFIL has been successful overall in
guaranteeing stability and security in southern Lebanon
and along the Blue Line, thus making a vital
contribution to the quest for peace in the Middle East.
It is also crucial that the resolution reaffirms the target
of a permanent ceasefire and of a long-term solution.
We are convinced that the full stabilization of southern
Lebanon is strictly linked with the fundamental aim of
a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
UNIFIL has not had an easy task. It faces many
challenges and risks, as recent tragic events have
unfortunately proved. In that regard, I wish to take this
opportunity to pay tribute once again to the
peacekeepers from Colombia, France and Spain who
lost their lives in Lebanon. It is fundamental the
UNIFIL be provided with the necessary assets to face
the existing risks and threats. We are sure that the
Secretary-General will keep working on the measures
best suited to guaranteeing full security for the
mission’s personnel.
Realizing the importance of UNIFIL’s task and
the relevance of the challenges it faces, we have
worked from the beginning for prompt, consensus
approval of the resolution. We therefore particularly
welcome today’s vote and the renewal of the mandate
the mission was given in 2006. Coming as it does well
in advance of the expiration of UNIFIL’s mandate and
with the unanimous support of the Council, it sends a
strong message of support to UNIFIL and to the
Department for Peacekeeping Operations, highlighting
the consensus in the Council and in the international
community on the effective and irreplaceable role of
UNIFIL.
Mr. Al-Henzab (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation voted in favour of resolution 1773 (2007),
which stresses the importance of the sovereignty and
political independence of Lebanon. Our position
respects the request from the Lebanese Government in
S/PV.5733
07-489074
this connection. We reaffirm our consistent strong
support for all those working as part of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), to which
Qatar is also contributing troops. My delegation hopes
that, with the adoption of the resolution, the parties
will respect their responsibilities in accordance with
the resolution in order to reach a permanent ceasefire.
We look forward to the Council shouldering its
responsibility to bring about stability and peace in the
region.
Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): The unanimous adoption
of resolution 1773 (2007), which extends the mandate
of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) for 12 months, reflects the continued
commitment of the Security Council and the United
Nations to the realization of a peaceful and stable
Lebanon. After one year of its deployment, UNIFIL not
only has provided the Lebanese with the opportunity to
rebuild and restore the country’s daily life, but also has
helped to establish a new strategic military and security
environment in southern Lebanon.
The extension of UNIFIL’s mandate and the
mission’s continued presence in Lebanon will bring
greater tangible results only when all parties concerned
fulfil their obligations under resolution 1701 (2006),
including the obligation to provide detailed data on the
use of cluster munitions in southern Lebanon. All
parties must also exercise restraint with regard to
actions that could undermine resolution 1701 (2006)
and UNIFIL, including the continued violations of
Lebanon’s airspace. Regrettably, the resolution does
not address that matter in an appropriate way. Lebanese
sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected
in their entirety.
The permanent ceasefire, as envisaged by
resolution 1701 (2006), is still far from being a reality.
The role of UNIFIL in monitoring the cessation of
hostilities and in achieving a permanent ceasefire
remains critical. Thus, extending the mandate of
UNIFIL is of paramount importance.
Finally, Indonesia wishes to reaffirm its
commitment to UNIFIL through its unflagging political
support as well as the continued presence of its
contingent in Lebanon and its intended contribution of
additional assets to UNIFIL’s Maritime Task Force.
Mr. Christian (Ghana): We welcome today’s
unanimous vote on the renewal of the mandate of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
We commend UNIFIL for its sacrifices and for its role
in the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). We
also commend the peacekeeping partnership and the
cooperation between the Lebanese Armed Forces and
UNIFIL, and urge that measures taken to enhance the
level of cooperation between them be sustained. By
providing humanitarian assistance, UNIFIL is
contributing to the improvement of the quality of life
of ordinary Lebanese on a daily basis.
We are concerned by threats to the safety of
UNIFIL personnel and condemn the recent attacks on
such personnel resulting in the death of Spanish
peacekeepers and damage to a military police vehicle
belonging to the Tanzanian contingent. Ghana looks
forward to the outcome of the ongoing investigations
into those incidents with a view to bringing the
perpetrators to justice, and we call on all parties to
respect the principles of international law. Ghana
welcomes the measures taken so far by the Secretary-
General, including efforts to deploy additional risk
mitigation assets, to enhance the safety of UNIFIL
personnel.
In the light of the prevailing security and political
situation in Lebanon, Ghana, as a country contributing
troops to UNIFIL and in keeping with its dedication to
the pursuit of global peace and security, welcomes the
renewal of the existing mandate of UNIFIL, whose
continued presence will be desirable in consolidating
stability in Lebanon.
Mr. Belle (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 1773
(2007). As a troop contributor, Belgium obviously fully
supports the resolution, which extends the current
mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) for a 12-month period, until 31
August 2008. In our view, it is undeniable that
UNIFIL has been and continues to be a stabilizing
element in southern Lebanon and in the zone.
By adopting this resolution, the Security Council
is sending a clear and strong signal: it is endorsing the
undeniable initial success of this mission and
reaffirming its confidence in UNIFIL with regard to the
discharge of its mandate. In addition to condemning
the attacks against UNIFIL, the resolution recalls that
the security of UNIFIL’s contingents and personnel
remains paramount for the fulfilment of its mission.
Mr. Wolff (United States of America): The
United States welcomes the unanimous adoption of
S/PV.5733
507-48907
resolution 1773 (2007) to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for
one year. That vote is a clear signal of the Council’s
support for the United Nations peacekeepers on the
ground in south Lebanon and of its commitment to the
full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006).
Although the primary aim of this technical
resolution is to extend the mandate of UNIFIL, it also
reaffirms the Council’s resolutions on Lebanon,
including resolutions 1559 (2004), 1680 (2006) and
1701 (2006), as well as the three presidential
statements on Lebanon adopted since last summer.
We commend the progress that has been achieved
since the adoption of resolution 1701 (2006) last
summer. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has
deployed throughout the country for the first time in 30
years. Together with the reinforced UNIFIL, the LAF
has helped to create a new strategic reality in south
Lebanon.
At the same time, the deadly 24 June attack
against UNIFIL and the 17 June rocket attack against
Israel demonstrate that there are unauthorized armed
elements and weapons in south Lebanon and that they
pose a danger both to regional stability and to the
safety of United Nations personnel. In that regard, we
reiterate our condolences to the families, colleagues
and Governments of those peacekeepers killed in the
line of duty in Lebanon.
We welcome UNIFIL’s intention to redouble its
efforts to carry out its mandate in response to these
attacks, especially in terms of coordination with the
Lebanese Armed Forces. We urge UNIFIL and the LAF
to move quickly to establish joint patrols and co-located
checkpoints, particularly along the Litani river, to
ensure that no unauthorized weapons are transferred
into south Lebanon. We look forward to hearing more
from the Secretary-General on those efforts in his next
report.
These and other threats to peace, as well as the
violence perpetrated by Fatah al-Islam in the north of
Lebanon, underscore the need to fully implement the
provisions of the Taif Accords and resolution 1559
(2004), calling for the disbanding and disarmament of
all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militia. Peace will
never be fully secured until that call is met.
We also reiterate our deep concern about
continued illegal weapons transfers across the Syrian-
Lebanese border in violation of resolution 1701 (2006).
Those weapons transfers directly threaten both the
stability of Lebanon and the safety of United Nations
peacekeepers. We join the Secretary-General in calling,
yet again, on Syria and Iran to honour their obligations
under the arms embargo established under resolution
1701 (2006).
One year has now passed since the cessation of
hostilities between Israel and Hizbullah and the
adoption of resolution 1701 (2006). While we are
pleased by the progress that has been achieved, we
deplore the fact that the cause of this conflict —
namely, Hizbullah’s abduction of the two Israeli
soldiers — has not been resolved. The Council must
not relent in demanding progress on that issue, as well
as on all the others required for a ceasefire and a long-
term solution between Israel and Lebanon, in order to
fulfil the promise of the resolution that we adopted last
summer.
Mr. Shcherbak (Russian Federation) (spoke in
Russian): The Russian Federation welcomes today’s
unanimous adoption of resolution 1773 (2007), which
extends for another year the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We feel
that its adoption is a great step towards strengthening
the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon. We
are grateful to the peacekeepers for the stabilizing role
they are playing in Lebanon, maintaining peace and
security in that country.
At the same time, we feel that the resolution is a
compromised text and that other issues that were raised
here today in the statements by our colleagues, in
particular the question of weapons smuggling, do not
relate to the text that we have just adopted. We could
also continue the list of problems, as we indicated in
our discussions on the resolution, including as regards
cluster bombs.
In conclusion, we would like to once again stress
our delegation’s gratitude for the unanimous adoption
of this resolution.
The President (spoke in French): There are no
other speakers on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.50 a.m.
