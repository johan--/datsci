The situation in the Middle East

Security Council 3947th meeting
Fifty-third year 25 November 1998
The meeting was called to order at 12.55 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Disengagement Observer Force
(S/1998/1073)
The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force, document S/1998/1073.
Members of the Council also have before them document
S/1998/1115, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/1998/1115) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bahrain, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, France, Gabon,
Gambia, Japan, Kenya, Portugal, Russian Federation,
Slovenia, Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1211 (1998).
In connection with the resolution just adopted on the
renewal of the mandate of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force, I have been authorized to
make the following complementary statement on behalf of
the Security Council:
“As is known, the report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force (S/1998/1073) states, in paragraph 8:
Despite the present quiet in the Israeli-Syrian
sector, the situation in the Middle East continues to
be potentially dangerous and is likely to remain so,
unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering
all aspects of the Middle East problem can be
reached.' That statement of the Secretary-General
reflects the view of the Security Council.”
This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1998/33.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 1 p.m.
