The meeting was called to order at 4.35 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Reports of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
Report of the Secretary-General on the Sudan
(S/2009/211)
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/225, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United States of
America. Members of the Council also have before
them document S/2009/211, which contains the report
of the Secretary-General on the Sudan.
It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1870 (2009).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Ms. Rice (United States of America): We are very
pleased that the Council has unanimously adopted the
renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Mission
in the Sudan (UNMIS). The Council‚Äôs vote reflects its
unwavering support for the work of the United Nations
in Southern Sudan. It also reflects the Council‚Äôs
continued belief that the full implementation of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement is vital to bringing
lasting peace to the people of Sudan.
After years of conflict and economic deprivation,
the citizens of Sudan deserve a future of peace and
promise. The Sudanese people are faced with many
challenges. We are concerned about the deterioration of
relations between Chad and Sudan. The relationship
between those two countries affects peace throughout
Sudan, and for that reason we welcome the Qatar- and
Libyan-sponsored bilateral talks in Doha between Chad
and Sudan as a positive step forward.
We remain, however, deeply concerned about the
negative impact on the three areas caused by the
Government of Sudan‚Äôs 4 and 5 March expulsions of
13 international aid organizations, to say nothing of the
humanitarian needs in Darfur and the suffering that its
people will face as a result of the expulsions. The
United States believes that there is absolutely no
justification for the Government of Sudan‚Äôs actions.
The sudden expulsions of the non-governmental
organizations put too many innocent civilians at grave
risk.
The Government of Sudan bears primary
responsibility for its people, and therefore we urge
Sudan to take immediate steps to restore effective
assistance to Sudan‚Äôs most vulnerable civilians. We
fully support UNMIS as it continues its work by
helping to implement the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement, to protect vulnerable civilians and to assist
the people of Sudan to achieve a lasting peace.
Mr. Ripert (France) (spoke in French): France
fully supports the activities of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) and more generally
speaking those of the Secretary-General and of the
United Nations system in that country. France is firmly
committed to the implementation of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which UNMIS is
mandated to assist. The Agreement has helped put an
end to several decades of conflict and has defined a
framework for peace, unity and the future development
of the Sudan.
We are also firmly committed to the peaceful
resolution of the Darfur crisis, which has for several
years made necessary the largest humanitarian
operation in the world. In that context, we back the
Secretary-General‚Äôs three tracks for action to address
the crisis situation created by the decision of the
Government of the Sudan to expel numerous
S/PV.6116
309-31939
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as clearly
described in the report of the Secretary-General
(S/2009/211).
In particular, we continue to call upon the
Government of the Sudan to reverse the closures and
expulsions of NGOs which until recently provided a
key portion of the humanitarian assistance to the
population, especially in the Three Areas, and to
restore an environment conducive to the work of
humanitarian actors. We note, as the Secretary-General
notes in his report, that ‚Äúthe expulsions and closures
have the potential to create a serious humanitarian
crisis‚Äù (S/2009/211, para. 88).
France is committed to ensuring that the Security
Council and the United Nations system follow the
situation very closely, without underestimating its
gravity, in order to ensure that all parties shoulder their
responsibility under international humanitarian law and
under the commitments they have undertaken, and to
make it possible for humanitarian assistance to reach
people who today desperately need it.
Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation welcomes the resolution that we have just
adopted, reaffirming the Council‚Äôs commitment to the
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement and to peace and stability in the Sudan. But
that commitment also obliges us to raise another issue
that could have negative repercussions for initiatives to
promote peace and stability. I am referring specifically
to the decision of the Government of the Sudan to
expel and suspend humanitarian and development
assistance organizations. That decision has left the
Three Areas and eastern Sudan with very little support
for humanitarian recovery and reintegration activities.
The provision of humanitarian aid for
development in those areas is essential if the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement is to be successfully
implemented. That was the understanding of the
Council when it considered this issue in its
consultations on 6, 20 and 26 March, following
briefings by the Assistant Secretary-General for
Humanitarian Affairs, the Director of the Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Under-
Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and
Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. John Holmes.
That is why, in my delegation‚Äôs view, it was only
natural that the resolution renewing the mandate of the
United Nations Mission in the Sudan should have
included in its preambular and operative paragraphs the
Council‚Äôs rejection of the measures taken by the
Government of the Sudan against humanitarian and
development assistance organizations, given the
negative implications that that decision could have for
humanitarian assistance and the implementation of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement. We wanted that
reference to be retained in the resolution‚Äôs tenth
preambular paragraph and in its operative
paragraph 13, as it was in all negotiated drafts until the
final one.
Nevertheless, we voted today for a text that no
longer contains those references. That is why we
understand that, when it refers in its ninth preambular
paragraph to ‚Äúthe events of March 4 and 5 2009‚Äù, the
resolution adopted today is referring to the decision to
expel humanitarian and development assistance
organizations.
I conclude by reiterating that the issue of
humanitarian assistance should not be linked to others
of a political or judicial nature. The Government of the
Sudan continues to be duty-bound to comply with the
decisions adopted by the Council and with the
commitments it has undertaken under various
international agreements and instruments. Furthermore,
it is obliged to protect its population and to comply
with the norms of international law, in particular
international humanitarian law.
Sir John Sawers (United Kingdom): The
Government of the United Kingdom welcomes the
unanimous adoption today of resolution 1870 (2009),
renewing the mandate of the United Nations Mission in
the Sudan (UNMIS). The Security Council‚Äôs unity in
support of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and
the North-South peace process is an important signal to
the Government of the Sudan and to the wider
international community. The Comprehensive Peace
Agreement ended one of Africa‚Äôs longest and bloodiest
civil wars, and it remains the bedrock for peace and
security in the Sudan.
As resolution 1870 (2009) makes clear, the
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement has reached a critical stage, and significant
tests lie ahead: on elections; on the process of
disarming and rehabilitating former combatants; on
developing effective security in the border areas; on
the national census, with regard to which the resolution
expresses concern about the delay in announcing the
S/PV.6116
09-319394
results; and on the referendum on unity, due in January
2011.
In the light of the Sudan‚Äôs recent expulsion of 13
international non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
the United Kingdom particularly welcomes the
language in the resolution stressing the importance of
providing humanitarian assistance to the civilian
populations throughout the Sudan. The expulsions
affect not only the people of Darfur, but also the
delivery of humanitarian aid across the whole of the
country, including the Three Areas on the borders
between North and South.
Resolution 1870 (2009) urges the Sudan to
support the three-track approach delineated by the
Secretary-General to ensure continuity of humanitarian
assistance. The first of those tracks is for the Sudan to
reverse its decision to expel the NGOs. The United
Kingdom repeats today its condemnation of that
decision and, in line with resolution 1870 (2009), urges
the Sudan to immediately reverse it. We hope that the
Sudan will respond to the Council‚Äôs call.
Finally, the United Kingdom also welcomes the
request, contained in the resolution, that the Secretary-
General develop benchmarks for measuring and
tracking progress in the implementation of UNMIS‚Äôs
mandate and assess progress against these in his
regular reports. That request, relating to the United
Nations Mission in the Sudan, follows similar requests
from the Council on other peacekeeping missions, such
as the United Nations Mission in the Central African
Republic and Chad and the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. It is an important step in the Council‚Äôs
efforts to further improve the effectiveness and
direction of United Nations peacekeeping across the
continent of Africa.
Mr. Takasu (Japan): Japan welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 1870 (2009). We
strongly hope for the continuous, effective
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement and urge redoubled support for the
extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), which is playing a
crucial role in assisting in the implementation of the
Agreement.
On this occasion, we express our deep concern at
the expulsion of major non-governmental organizations
by the Sudan, which has seriously affected
humanitarian and reconstruction efforts throughout the
Sudan, including the transitional Three Areas. We are
also concerned at the consequences that the expulsion
will have for the implementation of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement.
Japan supports the Secretary-General‚Äôs call for
the Sudanese Government to reconsider its decision.
The cooperation, jointly sponsored and promoted by
the United Nations and the Government of the Sudan,
in addressing the humanitarian gap, including the joint
technical assessment mission, is a very positive step.
However, it is not clear whether the resulting gap can
be adequately filled in that manner. We urge the
Government of the Sudan to provide a secure
environment for smooth humanitarian activities.
As the implementation of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement enters a very critical phase, it is
essential to accelerate the political process. We urge
both parties to make further efforts to that end, and we
call on the international community to continue to
support such efforts.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers on my list. The Security Council has
thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of
the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 4.45 p.m.
