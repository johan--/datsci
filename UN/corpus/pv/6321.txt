The meeting was called to order at 12.50 p.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Chad, the Central African Republic
and the subregion
Report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Mission in the Central African
Republic and Chad (S/2010/217)
The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Chad, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council’s agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Allam-mi
(Chad) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/251, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2010/217, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission
in the Central African Republic and Chad.
I also wish to draw the attention of Council
members to document S/2010/250, which contains a
letter dated 21 May 2010 from the Permanent
Representative of Chad to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America.
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1923 (2010).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria): Austria voted in
favour of the resolution although we would have
preferred a more gradual approach to be taken in the
drawdown of the United Nations Mission in the Central
African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT), as well as
the continuation of a protection of civilians mandate
for the Mission. At the same time, we note and
underscore that MINURCAT has at least been
authorized to respond to imminent threats of violence
to civilians in its immediate vicinity.
We respect the decision of the Government of
Chad to assume full responsibility of the security and
stability of the civilian population in eastern Chad,
including refugees, internally displaced persons,
returnees and host communities. We appreciate the
efforts undertaken by the Chadian authorities to provide
the Security Council with a better understanding of
their plans and capabilities in this field. We trust that
the Government of Chad will do its utmost to fulfil its
responsibilities and use all available capabilities for the
protection of the population in Eastern Chad.
At the same time, it is of the greatest importance
that the joint Government of Chad/United Nations
high-level working group assume the key role provided
for in the resolution and regularly assess the situation
on the ground with respect to the protection of civilians
and humanitarian access. We call upon the Government
of Chad and the Secretariat to cooperate as closely as
possible within the working group.
There is a continued need for the Council to
follow developments closely and to be regularly
informed about the situation on the ground. Austria
believes that the possibility of a further international
S/PV.6321
310-37507
engagement in eastern Chad should not be excluded if
deemed necessary for humanitarian reasons.
The President (spoke in Arabic): There are no
further speakers on my list. The Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.
