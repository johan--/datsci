The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the
Congo
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council’s agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mwamba
Kapanga (Democratic Republic of the Congo) took a
seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document
S/1999/400, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council’s prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/1999/396, which contains the
text of a letter dated 7 April 1999 from the Permanent
Representative of Kenya to the United Nations addressed
to the President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/1999/400) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
