The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Croatia, in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council’s agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the

accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and

There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nobilo

of a letter dated 1 November 1996 from the Chargé
d’affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
