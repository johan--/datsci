The meeting was called to order at 10.40 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in Liberia
Fourth progress report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations
Mission in Liberia (S/2004/725)
The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Liberia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item on
the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council‚Äôs provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kawah
(Liberia) took a seat at the Council table.
The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the
fourth progress report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Mission in Liberia, document
S/2004/725. Members also have before them document
S/2004/740, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council‚Äôs prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1561 (2004).
I give the floor to the representative of the United
States of America, who wishes to make a statement
following the vote.
Mr. Danforth (United States of America): It is
the policy of the United States Government to ensure
that members of the armed services of the United
States of America participating in United Nations
peace operations are protected from criminal
prosecution or other assertion of jurisdiction by the
International Criminal Court. Normally, the United
States would seek express provisions providing such
protection for personnel from States not party to the
Rome Statute that contribute to any mission established
or authorized by the United Nations. In this instance,
the United States maintains sufficient bilateral
protections with the Government of Liberia to facilitate
continued United States participation in the United
Nations Mission in Liberia absent such express
provisions in the mandate extension.
The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.45 a.m.
