Expression of farewell to Mr. Francis K. Butagira,
Permanent Representative of Uganda to the
United Nations
The President (spoke in French): I have been
informed that our respected colleague, Ambassador
Francis Butagira, Permanent Representative of Uganda,
is attending a Security Council meeting for the last
time today before he returns to Uganda. Our
cooperation with him within the Council has been far
too brief, but Ambassador Butagira has been the
Permanent Representative of Uganda to the United
Nations for five years. During that period, we have all
had the opportunity to work closely with him in one
way or another, and, in doing so, we have been able to
appreciate his great professional qualities, the
experience that he has always been ready to share with
us, the kindness and courtesy he showed his
colleagues, his great openness and his spirit of
cooperation. We regret his departure and wish him
every success in his future duties.
