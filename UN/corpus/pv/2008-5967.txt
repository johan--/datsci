The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
The situation in the Middle East
Letter dated 21 August 2008 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the President of
the Security Council (S/2008/568)
The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Lebanon and Israel, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council‚Äôs agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the consideration of the item, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council‚Äôs
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Salam
(Lebanon) and Mr. Carmon (Israel) took seats at
the Council table.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/583, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, Croatia, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
Members also have before them document S/2008/425,
containing the report of the Secretary-General on the
implementation of Security Council resolution 1701
(2006), and document S/2008/568, containing the text
of a letter dated 21 August 2008 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security
Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America, Viet
Nam
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1832 (2008).
I now give the floor to the representative of
Israel.
Mr. Carmon (Israel): At the outset, allow me to
congratulate you, Sir, on your able stewardship of the
Council during the month of August. I would like to
take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General
and the relevant Member States for their involvement
and engagement and for their continuing commitment
to the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). I
would also like to express appreciation to the troop-
contributing countries, the Commander of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), the
Strategic Cell in New York and the troops on the
ground. Israel appreciates the difficulty of their task
and values their dedication. They have been fulfilling
their mission serving the values of peacekeeping,
which has been characterized by growing complexity
and challenges, especially over the past year.
Israel welcomes the extension of UNIFIL‚Äôs
mandate for another year. UNIFIL plays an important
role in south Lebanon, with the main task of assisting
in the establishment, between the Blue Line and the
Litani River, of an area free of all armed personnel,
assets and weapons other than those of the Government
of Lebanon and UNIFIL.
It has been more than two years since the
adoption of resolution 1701 (2006), and the situation in
Lebanon appears to be one of ongoing concern. Today,
more than ever before, we are witnessing challenges to
UNIFIL‚Äôs activities and mandate. The presence and
massive redeployment of armed Hizbullah elements
and their acquisition of capabilities both north and
south of the Litani River, along with the continuous
transfer of weapons from Iran and Syria to Hizbullah,
are blatant violations of resolution 1701 (2006) and
S/PV.5967
308-49182
other relevant Security Council resolutions. In that
context, let me refer members to the first report of the
Lebanon Independent Border Assessment Team
(LIBAT), which speaks for itself. I am confident that
LIBAT‚Äôs second report, which is expected shortly, will
only strengthen the findings of its predecessor.
The recent report of the Secretary-General on the
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) (S/2008/425)
highlights the challenges faced by UNIFIL. The report
clearly identifies several incidents in which hostile
groups equipped with unauthorized arms observed and
monitored UNIFIL‚Äôs activities and impeded its freedom
of movement. Those incidents, which are only part of a
larger phenomenon, not only represent ongoing
violations of resolution 1701 (2006), but also constitute
a danger to the stability in our region. In that regard,
they also pose a threat to the safety of UNIFIL‚Äôs
personnel.
In that light, Israel expects UNIFIL, under its
renewed mandate, to exert its authority to take all
necessary action in areas where its forces are deployed,
to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for
hostile activities of any kind and to resist attempts to
prevent it from discharging its mandate. As we all see,
that is indeed a great challenge.
The new policy guidelines of the Lebanese
Government further complicate, inter alia, the efforts
of UNIFIL to fulfil its mandate. That development
contradicts the core elements of resolution 1701
(2006). Further, it raises concerns as to the
commitment of the Lebanese Government to extend,
under resolution 1701 (2006), its authority over all of
its territory through its own legitimate armed forces so
that there will be no weapons present without the
consent of the Government of Lebanon and no
authority other than that of the Government of
Lebanon. Instead of encouraging one of the main
elements of resolution 1701 (2006) ‚Äî the disarmament
of all armed groups in Lebanon ‚Äî the new guidelines,
in effect, support Hizbullah‚Äôs actions. That should be
of major concern to all.
Let me stress once again Israel‚Äôs appreciation to
the international community for its continued
engagement through the present resolution and for the
work of UNIFIL. Israel attributes great importance to
the cooperation between UNIFIL and the concerned
parties, including the cooperation carried out through
the tripartite meetings. For its part, Israel remains
committed to cooperating with the Security Council,
the Secretary-General, the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations and UNIFIL on the ground in the fulfilment
of resolution 1701 (2006), other relevant Security
Council resolutions regarding Lebanon and this
important resolution.
The President (spoke in French): I now give the
floor to the representative of Lebanon.
Mr. Salam (Lebanon): At the outset, I would like
to extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on your
assumption of the presidency of the Security Council
for the current month. I would also like to recognize
your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of Viet
Nam, for his effective stewardship of the Council last
month.
First and foremost, my Government would like to
thank, through you, Mr. President, all members of the
Council for the decision taken today to renew for
another year the mandate of the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). I am sure you are aware
how important today‚Äôs Council decision is to my fellow
Lebanese citizens, who have been the victims of
repeated Israeli aggressions since the 1978 invasion,
which led to the adoption of Security Council
resolution 425 (1978) and to the creation of the first
UNIFIL. We would also like to take this opportunity to
commend UNIFIL for its remarkable work; to praise
the wise and courageous leadership of its Commander,
General Graziano; and to thank all troop-contributing
countries and the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations.
In two days‚Äô time, it will be the second
anniversary of the adoption of Council resolution 1701
(2006). During those two years, the Lebanese
Government has reaffirmed time and again its
commitment to the full implementation of the
resolution in its entirety and to working closely with
UNIFIL in pursuit of security and stability in its area of
operations. What greater evidence of the seriousness of
that commitment could there be than the deployment of
the Lebanese army in the south promptly after the
adoption of resolution 1701 (2006)? Let me also
mention the appreciation of my Government for the
technical support provided by the two Lebanon
Independent Border Assessment Team (LIBAT)
missions and assure the Council that it will continue to
give due consideration to the LIBAT reports.
S/PV.5967

We need to acknowledge the fact that resolution
1701 (2006), two years after its adoption, has not been
fully implemented. What else can we conclude when
Israel continues to violate Lebanese airspace on a daily
basis, as stated by the Secretary-General in his seventh
report on the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006)
(S/2008/425); when Israel persists in its refusal to hand
over to the United Nations the maps of the deadly
cluster bombs it has planted in the fields and farms of
southern Lebanon; when Israel does not withdraw from
the northern part of Al-Ghajar village; and when a
solution to the Shabaa Farms issue, as proposed by the
Lebanese Government in its seven-point plan, has not
yet been reached?
Accordingly, can there still be any doubt about
the identity of the party that must be held responsible
for obstructing the full implementation of resolution
1701 (2006). Indeed, res ipsa loquitur ‚Äî the thing
speaks for itself, says the legal adage.
Moreover, it is surprising that Mr. Ehud Barak,
Defence Minister of Israel, continues to refuse to meet
General Graziano, the Commander of UNIFIL, to
discuss the situation on the Lebanese border and the
implementation of United Nations Security Council
resolution 1701 (2006). ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been asking for a
meeting with Barak for six months, but they keep
putting me off‚Äù, Graziano is reported to have said,
according to the Israeli daily Haaretz. On 22 August
2008, Haaretz also reported that Graziano has been
complaining that he has not been able to meet Israeli
Chief-of-Staff Ashkenazi either.
More disturbing, however, is the fact that Israeli
officials, including Prime Minister Olmert, have
recently been launching a series of alarming threats
against Lebanon under various pretexts and allegations.
This prompted our Prime Minister, Mr. Fuad Siniora, to
write to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 22 August,
warning that the current ongoing violations by Israel of
Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), coupled with
recurring statements containing the threat of the use of
force and coercion against Lebanon, raised serious
concerns about Israeli intentions.
Mr. Siniora urged him to address firmly Israel‚Äôs
defiance of its obligations to fully abide by the letter
and spirit of United Nations Security Council
resolution 1701 (2006).
Against this background, I am confident that the
Council will understand why I would like to thank it
for the important resolution adopted today. It carries an
unequivocal and renewed commitment to the territorial
integrity, independence and sovereignty of my country.
The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
