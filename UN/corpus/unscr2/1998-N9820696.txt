Adopted by the Security Council at its 3907th meeting,
on 15 July 1998
The Security Council,
Recalling all its earlier relevant resolutions, in particular its
resolutions 779 (1992) of 6 October 1992, 981 (1995) of 31 March 1995 and
1147 (1998) of 13 January 1998,
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 26 June 1998
(S/1998/578) and noting the positive assessment in the Secretary-Generalâ€™s
report of recent developments, including the initiative by the Republic of
Croatia (S/1998/533, Annex) for a final resolution of the disputed issue of
Prevlaka,
Noting also the proposal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (S/1998/632,
Annex), on the permanent settlement of the disputed issue of Prevlaka,
Reaffirming once again its commitment to the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia within its internationally
recognized borders,
Noting again the Joint Declaration signed at Geneva on 30 September 1992 by
the Presidents of the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, in particular Article 3, which reaffirmed their agreement concerning
the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula, and emphasizing the contribution
that this demilitarization has made to the decrease of tension in the region,
Concerned, however, at the continued long-standing violations of the
demilitarization regime in the United Nations designated zones in the region and
the failure of the parties to improve their compliance with the demilitarization
regime as recommended by the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka,
including important demining activities within the demilitarized area, and by
continued restrictions on the freedom of movement of its personnel within their
area of responsibility,

the United Nations and good-neighbourly relations, and deeply concerned at the

promptly the demining of the area;

them to engage promptly and constructively in negotiations;
5. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the Council by
15 October 1998 a report on the situation in the Prevlaka peninsula and in

differences, and in this context on the possible adaptation of the United
Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka;
