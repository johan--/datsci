The Security Council,
Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and presidential statements concerning
the situation in Sudan and underlining the importance of full compliance with these,
Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and
territorial integrity of Sudan and its determination to work with the Government of
Sudan, in full respect of its sovereignty, to assist in tackling the various challenges
in Sudan,
Recalling the importance of the principles of the peaceful settlement of
international disputes, good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in
the relations among States in the region,
Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the
parties, impartiality and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the
mandate, and recognizing that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific
to the country concerned,
Reaffirming its resolutions 1265 (1999), 1296 (2000), 1674 (2006), 1738
(2006) and 1894 (2009) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, and 1502

resolution 2086 (2013) on United Nations peacekeeping operations,
Expressing deep concern at the serious deterioration in the security situation
overall so far in 2014, and the profound negative impact of this on civilians, in
particular women and children, including through continued clashes between
Government forces and rebel armed groups, an escalation of inter-tribal fighting and
other local clashes, including with the involvement of paramilitary units and tribal
militias, and an increase in criminality and banditry, further expressing deep
concern that such clashes, including attacks by rebel groups and Government forces
and aerial bombardment by the Government of Sudan, inter-tribal fighting, banditry
and criminality continue to threaten civilians, while welcoming a slight
improvement in the security situation since May; and reiterating its demand that all
S/RES/2173 (2014)
14-599572/9
parties to the conflict in Darfur immediately end violence, including attacks on
civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel,
Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013) and expressing concern at the threat to
peace and security in Darfur arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing
accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and the continued threats
to civilians posed by unexploded ordnance,
Expressing deep concern at the significant increase in population
displacements this year and the consequent increase in humanitarian assistance and
protection needs, with an estimated 359,000 newly displaced since January this year,
around 260,000 of whom have been unable to return to their homes, alongside more
than 2 million long-term Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs),
Recalling the commitments made by the Government of Sudan and other
signatories to the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) to ensure the
unimpeded access of humanitarian assistance to the population in need and the
protection of humanitarian workers and their operations in areas under their control,
as well as to guarantee the AU-UN Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID)
unimpeded freedom of movement in all areas and at all times in Darfur in the
exercise of its mandate,
Further expressing concern that the suspension of operations or the
withdrawal of some international humanitarian actors have left significant gaps in
the delivery of humanitarian assistance, calling on the Government of Sudan to
ensure humanitarian actors can operate in support of addressing basic needs, and
calling on donors, the Darfur Regional Authority and the Government of Sudan to
provide the financial resources necessary to reach those in need,
Reiterating that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur, and
that an inclusive political settlement is essential to re-establishing peace, and
underscoring the importance of fully addressing the root causes of the conflict in the
search for a sustainable peace, which should rapidly deliver real benefits for the
Darfuri people, in this regard reiterating its support for the DDPD as a viable
framework for the Darfur peace process, and for its accelerated implementation, and
noting that this process and the national initiative for dialogue in Sudan could be
complementary and mutually reinforcing processes,
Welcoming in this regard the announcement by President Bashir on 27 January
of a national dialogue, noting that the modalities of such a dialogue should provide
an opportunity to address the legitimate grievances of the people of Darfur, that the
national dialogue has the potential to offer an opportunity to pave the way for
lasting peace throughout Sudan, building on existing peace processes including the
DDPD, noting the stated commitment of the Government of Sudan to an inclusive
national dialogue, and calling for an enabling environment conducive to the national
dialogue, which would constitute a key step towards achieving a credible,
transparent, inclusive, nationally owned and Sudanese-led process; further calling
on all parties to engage constructively with this process, urging all parties to refrain
from any attempt to obstruct it, and looking forward to further developments
towards the implementation of an inclusive dialogue process,
Deploring the fact that some armed groups have refused to join the peace
process and are impeding the implementation of the DDPD, reiterating its demand
for the release of members of the former movement of Mohamed Bashar, taken
S/RES/2173 (2014)
3/914-59957
captive in May 2013 by JEM-Gibril forces, and condemning any actions by any
armed group aimed at forced overthrow of the Government of Sudan,
Noting in this regard that UNAMID’s ability to facilitate progress in
implementation of the DDPD is hampered by delays by the signatory parties and the
absence of an inclusive political settlement between the government and
non-signatory movements, urging the signatory parties to take the necessary
remaining steps to implement the DDPD fully, expressing concern that the
humanitarian and security situation, as well as lack of capacity of the Darfur
Regional Authority, hinder the transition from relief to stabilization and
development activities, urging donors and the Government of Sudan to honour their
pledges and fulfil their obligations in a timely manner, including those commitments
made at the conference in Doha in April 2013, welcoming the confirmation of the
Government of Qatar of its pledge of USD88.5 million, and the transfer of
USD10 million of this amount to the UN Darfur Fund in April, and affirming that
development can support a lasting peace in Darfur,
Noting that local dispute resolution mechanisms play an important role in
preventing and resolving inter-communal conflict, including conflict over natural
resources, and urging an intensification of effective efforts to prevent local disputes
leading to violence, with its corresponding impact on the local civilian populations,
acknowledging the efforts of Sudanese authorities and local mediators to mediate in
inter-tribal fighting, with support from UNAMID and the UN Country Team
(UNCT), and urging their continued work,
Welcoming regional and other initiatives, undertaken in close interaction with
the Government of Sudan, to address the root causes of the conflict in Darfur and to
promote a sustainable peace, including the convening by the President of Chad,

2014, and encouraging the full coordination of such initiatives with the efforts of
the Joint Special Representative,
Underlining, without prejudice to the Security Council’s primary responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security, the importance of the
partnership between the United Nations and the African Union (AU), consistent with
Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, with regard to the maintenance of
peace and security in Africa, particularly in Sudan,
Calling on all parties to comply with their obligations under international
human rights law and international humanitarian law, stressing the importance that
the Council attaches to ending impunity including through ensuring accountability
and bringing to justice the perpetrators of crimes committed by all parties in Darfur,
urging the Government of Sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect,
welcoming the ongoing investigations by the Special Prosecutor for Darfur
appointed by the Government of Sudan and stressing the need for further progress in
this regard, calling for swift progress on the draft Memorandum of Understanding
providing for UNAMID and African Union observation of the proceedings of the
Special Court, and calling on the Government of Sudan swiftly to investigate
attacks against UNAMID and to bring the perpetrators to justice,
Reaffirming its concern over the negative effect of ongoing violence in Darfur
on the stability of Sudan as a whole as well as the region, welcoming the ongoing
good relations between Sudan and Chad, including on border control, and
