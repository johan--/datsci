on 21 December 1995
The Security Council,
Reaffirming all its earlier relevant resolutions on the situation in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, including its resolution 1019 (1995) of 9 November 1995 and
condemning the Bosnian Serb partyâ€™s failure, despite repeated calls that it
should do so, to comply with the demands contained therein,

Deeply concerned by the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees and
displaced persons as a result of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia,
1. Strongly condemns all violations of international humanitarian law and
of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and demands that all
concerned comply fully with their obligations in this regard and reiterates that
all those who commit violations of international humanitarian law will be held
individually responsible in respect of such acts;

of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and
paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica, Zepa, Banja Luka and Sanski Most

showing a consistent pattern of summary executions, rape, mass expulsions,
arbitrary detentions, forced labour and large-scale disappearances;
3. Notes with the utmost concern the substantial evidence referred to in
the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 that an unknown but
large number of men in the area of Srebrenica, namely in Nova Kasaba-Konjevic
Polje (Kaldrumica), Kravice, Rasica Gai, Zabrde and two sites in Karakaj, and

unimpeded access to representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, the ICRC and other international agencies to persons displaced and to
persons detained or reported missing from Srebrenica, Zepa and the regions of
Banja Luka and Sanski Most who are within the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina
under the control of Bosnian Serb forces and that the Bosnian Serb party permit
representatives of the ICRC (i) to visit and register any persons detained
against their will, whether civilians or members of the forces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and (ii) to have access to any site it may deem important;
6. Affirms that the violations of humanitarian law and human rights in
the areas of Srebrenica, Zepa, Banja Luka and Sanski Most from July to
October 1995 must be fully and properly investigated by the relevant United
Nations and other international organizations and institutions;
7. Takes note that the International Tribunal established pursuant to
resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993 issued on 16 November 1995 indictments
against the Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic for their
direct and individual responsibilities for the atrocities committed against the
Bosnian Muslim population of Srebrenica in July 1995;

the region of the former Yugoslavia, and all parties to the conflict in the
former Yugoslavia, comply fully and in good faith with the obligations contained
in paragraph 4 of resolution 827 (1993) to cooperate fully with the
International Tribunal and calls on them to create the conditions essential for
the Tribunal to perform the task for which it has been created, including the
establishment of offices of the Tribunal when the latter deems it necessary;
13. Reiterates its demand that all detention camps throughout the
territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be immediately closed;
14. Urges the parties to ensure full respect for the norms of
international humanitarian law and of human rights of the civilian population,
living in the areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina now under their control, which
under the Peace Agreement will be transferred to another party;
15. Condemns the widespread looting and destruction of houses and other
property, in particular by HVO forces in the area of Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo,
and demands that all sides immediately stop such action, investigate them and
make sure that those who violated the law be held individually responsible in
respect of such acts;

those areas now under their control, which under the Peace Agreement will be
