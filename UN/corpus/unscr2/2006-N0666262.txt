Resolution 1728 (2006)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 5593rd meeting, on
15 December 2006
The Security Council,
Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 1 December 2006 (S/2006/931)
on the United Nations operation in Cyprus,
Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing
conditions in the island it is necessary to keep UNFICYP beyond 15 December
2006,
Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security
situation on the island continues to be generally stable and that the situation along
the Green Line remains calm, and welcoming the decrease in the overall number of
incidents involving the two sides,
Urging both sides to avoid any action which could lead to an increase in
tension such as military exercises and, in this context, noting with concern that
disagreements have arisen over civilian activities in the buffer zone, including
farming and construction, and encouraging both sides to engage in consultations
with UNFICYP on the demarcation of the buffer zone, respecting UNFICYP’s
mandate, and to reach an agreed approach to UNFICYP’s operations in the buffer
zone on the basis of the United Nations 1989 aide-memoire,
Expressing its strong appreciation for the work of Under-Secretary-General
Gambari in achieving the 8 July agreement and welcoming the principles and
decisions enshrined therein, including recognition that the status quo is unacceptable
and that a comprehensive settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation and
political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, is both
desirable and possible and should not be further delayed, but noting, with regret, the
Secretary-General’s assessment that continued lack of trust between the parties has
so far prevented the implementation of any of those decisions, underlining the need
to implement the 8 July agreement without further delay, and expressing the hope
that the recent positive reaction of the leaders of both communities to suggestions
by the United Nations will result in the finalisation of the preparatory phase as soon
as possible in order to prepare the ground for fully-fledged negotiations leading to a
comprehensive and durable settlement,
Welcoming continued progress in demining, expressing strong support for
UNFICYP’s efforts to extend demining operations to Turkish Forces minefields in
S/RES/1728 (2006)

the rest of the buffer zone, and welcoming the prospect that it could be declared free
of mines within two years,
Reiterating its call to the parties to assess and address the humanitarian issue
of missing persons with due urgency and seriousness, and welcoming in this regard
the resumption of the activities of the Committee on Missing Persons since August
2004, and the progress which has since been made, as well as the appointment by
the Secretary-General of a third member,
Welcoming the continuing crossings by Greek Cypriots to the north and
Turkish Cypriots to the south which have taken place peacefully, and encouraging
early progress on other confidence-building measures, such as the opening of
additional crossing points, including at Ledra Street,
Welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events, including,
inter alia, on the part of the United Nations, and urging the two sides to promote
further bicommunal contacts and to remove any obstacles to such contacts,
Expressing concern, in this respect, that opportunities for constructive public
debate about the future of the island, within and between the communities, are
becoming fewer, and that this atmosphere is hampering, in particular, efforts to
foster bicommunal activities intended to benefit Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots, and to promote reconciliation and build trust in order to facilitate a
comprehensive settlement,
Noting the primary role of the United Nations in assisting the parties to bring
the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a comprehensive and durable
settlement,
Reaffirming the importance of the Secretary-General continuing to keep the
operations of UNFICYP under close review while continuing to take into account
developments on the ground and the views of the parties, and reverting to the
Council with recommendations as appropriate for further adjustments to
UNFICYP’s mandate, force levels and concept of operation as soon as warranted,
Echoing the Secretary-General’s gratitude to the Government of Cyprus and
the Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding of
UNFICYP, and his request for further voluntary contributions from other countries
and organizations,
Welcoming and encouraging efforts by the United Nations to sensitize
peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other
communicable diseases in all its peacekeeping operations,
1. Welcomes the observations in the Secretary-General’s report on progress
since June, and in particular on developments since 8 July, and expresses
appreciation for his personal efforts over the last 10 years, and those of his staff,
aimed at achieving a comprehensive solution;

1251 (1999) of 29 June 1999 and subsequent resolutions;

2007;
4. Calls on the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces to restore in
Strovilia the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000;
S/RES/1728 (2006)
306-66262
5. Expresses full support for the process agreed by the leaders, encourages
active participation in bicommunal discussions as described in Under-Secretary-
General Gambari’s letter of 15 November 2006, under the auspices of the SRSG, and
calls for early completion of the preparatory phase so that a fully-fledged good
offices process may resume as soon as possible;
6. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on implementation of
this resolution by 1 June 2007;
7. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by UNFICYP to implement the
Secretary-General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to
ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct,
requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard
and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to
take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of predeployment
awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full
accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel;
8. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
