RESOLUTION 1193 (1998)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 3921st meeting,
on 28 August 1998
The Security Council,
Having considered the situation in Afghanistan,
Recalling its previous resolution 1076 (1996) of 22 October 1996 and the
statements of the President of the Security Council on the situation in
Afghanistan,
Recalling also resolution 52/211 of the General Assembly,
Expressing its grave concern at the continued Afghan conflict which has
recently sharply escalated due to the Taliban forcesâ€™ offensive in the northern
parts of the country, causing a serious and growing threat to regional and
international peace and security, as well as extensive human suffering, further
destruction, refugee flows and other forcible displacement of large numbers of
people,
Concerned also by the increasingly ethnic nature of the conflict, by
reports of ethnic and religious-based persecution, particularly against the
Shiites, and by the threat this poses to the unity of the Afghan State,
Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence,
territorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan, and its respect for its
cultural and historical heritage,
Deploring the fact that despite repeated pleas by the Security Council, the
General Assembly and the Secretary-General to halt foreign interference in
Afghanistan, including the involvement of foreign military personnel and the
supply of arms and ammunition to all parties in the conflict, such interference
continues unabated,
Reiterating its view that the United Nations must continue to play its
central and impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful
resolution of the Afghan conflict,

evacuation of the United Nations humanitarian personnel from Afghanistan and
expressing hope for their early return under conditions of security,

multi-ethnic country;

without delay and preconditions, and cooperate with the aim of creating a broad-

influence in the country to intensify their efforts under the aegis of the

parties to the conflict and all segments of Afghan society;

persecution in Afghanistan, and to submit the reports to the General Assembly
and the Security Council as soon as they become available;

girls and women and to other violations of human rights as well as violations of
international humanitarian law and to adhere to the internationally accepted
