further measures it will impose;

the two neighbouring States which have so far failed to respond substantively to
requests from the Committee established by resolution 864 (1993) for information

the Committee to provide a report to the Council, by 15 July 1994, on compliance
with the sanctions regime and in particular on possible violations of that

throughout Angola contrary to resolution 922 (1994) and reiterates its demand

and all actions which inhibit the free and unrestricted movement of humanitarian
relief and humanitarian relief workers;

and guarantees for relief deliveries to all locations, and to refrain from any
action which could jeopardize the safety of relief personnel or disrupt the
distribution of humanitarian assistance to the Angolan people;

organizations which have already contributed to the relief efforts, and appeals
to all States, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to
provide rapidly further assistance to Angola to meet the growing humanitarian
needs;
