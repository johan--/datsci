Resolution 1573 (2004)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 5079th meeting,
on 16 November 2004
The Security Council,
Reaffirming its previous resolutions on the situation in Timor-Leste, in
particular resolutions 1410 (2002) of 17 May 2002, 1473 (2003) of 4 April 2003,
1480 (2003) of 19 May 2003 and 1543 (2004) of 14 May 2004,
Commending the people and the Government of Timor-Leste for the peace and
stability they have achieved in the country, as well as for their continuing efforts
towards consolidating democracy and building state institutions,
Further commending the United Nations Mission of Support in Timor-Leste
(UNMISET), under the leadership of the Secretary-General’s Special
Representative, and welcoming the continuing progress made towards the
accomplishment of key tasks inscribed in its mandate, particularly during its
consolidation phase, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1543 (2004),
Paying tribute to Timor-Leste’s bilateral and multilateral partners for their
invaluable assistance, particularly with regards to institutional capacity building and
social and economic development,
Noting that, despite notable advances achieved in the last months, Timor-Leste
has not yet reached the critical threshold of self-sufficiency, mainly in key areas
such as public administration, law enforcement and security,
Welcoming the strengthening of cooperation and good relations between
Timor-Leste and its neighbours and encouraging further progress towards concrete
agreements on border delineation and other pending issues,
Commending the Serious Crimes Unit for the efforts it has undertaken in order
to complete its investigations by November 2004, and any further trials and other
activities no later than 20 May 2005,
Noting with concern that it may not be possible for the Serious Crimes Unit to
fully respond to the desire for justice of those affected by the violence in 1999
bearing in mind the limited time and resources that remain available,

S/RES/1573 (2004)
Taking note of the special report of the Secretary General on UNMISET of
29 April 2004 (S/2004/333) as well as of 19 November 2004 (S/2004/888), and
welcoming his recommendations contained therein,
Remaining fully committed to the promotion of security and long lasting
stability in Timor-Leste,
1. Decides to extend the mandate of UNMISET for a final period of
6 months until 20 May 2005;
2. Decides also to maintain UNMISET’s current tasks, configuration and
size in order to allow the mission to complete key tasks of its mandate and
consolidate gains made thus far;
3. Requests UNMISET to focus increasingly on implementing its exit
strategy, particularly with a view to ensure increasing involvement and ownership of
the Timorese in the mission’s three programme areas, so that, when it departs
Timor-Leste, its responsibilities can be taken over by the Timorese, with the
continued assistance of the United Nations system and bilateral and multilateral
partners;
4. Urges the donor community to continue providing its indispensable
assistance to Timor-Leste, including through active participation in the donor’s
conference scheduled to be held in March 2005;
5. Urges, in particular, United Nations development and humanitarian
agencies and multilateral financial institutions to start immediately planning for a
smooth transition, in Timor-Leste, from a peacekeeping operation to a sustainable
development assistance framework;
6. Reaffirms the need to fight against impunity and, in this regard, takes
note of the Secretary-General’s intention to continue to explore possible ways to
address this issue with a view to making proposals as appropriate;
7. Requests the Secretary-General to keep the Security Council closely and
regularly informed of developments on the ground and of the implementation of the
present resolution, in particular of paragraphs 3 and 5 above, and in that regard,
requests the Secretary-General to submit a report within three months of the date of
adoption of the present resolution, followed by a final report in May 2005;
8. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
