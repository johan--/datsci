10 August 1993, 866 (1993) of 22 September 1993, 911 (1994) of 21 April 1994,

Recalling also its resolution 788 (1992) of 19 November 1992, in which it
decided, under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, that all States
shall, for the purpose of establishing peace and stability in Liberia,
immediately implement a general and complete embargo on all deliveries of
weapons and military equipment to Liberia until the Security Council decides
otherwise, and in which it decided also that the embargo shall not apply to
weapons and military equipment destined for the sole use of the peace-keeping
forces of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Liberia,
subject to any review that may be required in conformity with the report of the
Secretary-General,
Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General dated
24 February 1995 (S/1995/158) and 10 April 1995 (S/1995/279) on the United
Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL),
Deeply concerned that the cease-fire in Liberia has broken down, precluding
the full deployment of UNOMIL and preventing UNOMIL from fully carrying out its
mandate,
Noting with deep concern that in violation of resolution 788 (1992) arms
continue to be imported into Liberia, exacerbating the conflict,
Welcoming the decision of ECOWAS to hold a summit of Heads of State in
May 1995,
1. Decides to extend the mandate of UNOMIL until 30 June 1995;

throughout Liberia and further demands that these factions facilitate such
deliveries and that they strictly abide by applicable rules of international
humanitarian law;
7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council by
15 June 1995 on the situation in Liberia, including whether there is an
