Resolution 1697 (2006)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 5501st meeting, on
31 July 2006
The Security Council,
Recalling all its previous resolutions on Lebanon, including resolutions
425 (1978) and 426 (1978) of 19 March 1978 and 1655 (2006) of 31 January 2006
as well as the statements of its President on the situation in Lebanon, in particular
the statement of 18 June 2000 (S/PRST/2000/21),
Expressing deepest concern at the escalation of hostilities in Lebanon and
Israel since 12 July 2006,
Taking note of the letter dated 7 July 2006 (S/2006/496) from the Chargé
d’affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations conveying
to the Secretary-General the request that the Security Council extend the mandate of
UNIFIL for a further period of six months,
Having examined the Secretary-General’s report on UNIFIL of 22 July 2006
(S/2006/560), including its observations that, as a result of the continuing hostilities
along the Blue Line, UNIFIL has been impeded to carry out its activities effectively,
and noting in this context the Secretary-General’s recommendation that the mandate
of the Force be extended for a period of one month pending consideration of other
options for future arrangements in South Lebanon,
1. Urges all concerned parties to abide scrupulously by their obligation to
respect the safety of UNIFIL and other United Nations personnel, and avoid any
course of action which might endanger United Nations personnel, and calls on them
to allow the Force to resupply its positions, conduct search and rescue operations on
behalf of its personnel and undertake any other measures the Force deems necessary
to ensure the safety of its personnel;
2. Decides to extend the mandate of UNIFIL until 31 August 2006;
3. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
