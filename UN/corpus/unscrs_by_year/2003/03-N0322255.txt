Reiterating its commitment to take appropriate action to help put an end to the

Determining that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
continues to constitute a threat to international peace and stability in the Great Lakes
region,
1. Takes note of the report of the Panel of Experts (hereinafter “the Panel”)
on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, transmitted by the Secretary-General in his
letter dated 15 October 2002 (S/2002/1146);
2. Strongly condemns the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo;
3. Notes with concern that the plundering of the natural resources and other
forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues and is one of
the main elements fuelling the conflict in the region, and in this regard, demands
2
S/RES/1457 (2003)
that all States concerned take immediate steps to end these illegal activities, which
are perpetuating the conflict, impeding the economic development of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and exacerbating the suffering of its people;
4. Reiterates that the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo should be exploited transparently, legally and on a fair commercial basis, to
benefit the country and its people;
5. Stresses that the completion of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from
the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as the early
establishment of an all-inclusive transitional government in the country, which will
ensure that central government control is reinstated and that viable administrations
are empowered to protect and regulate the exploitation activities, are important steps
towards ending the plundering of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo;
6. Stresses also that the possible convening of an international conference
on peace, security, democracy and development in the Great Lakes region at the
appropriate time could help the States of the region in promoting a sound regional
economic integration, to the benefit of all the States in the region;
7. Takes note of the importance of the natural resources and extractive
sectors for the future of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, encourages States,
international financial institutions, and other organizations to assist Governments in
the region in efforts to create appropriate national structures and institutions to
control resource exploitation, encourages also the Government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to work closely with the International Financial Institutions
and the donor community to establish Congolese institutional capacity to ensure that
these sectors are controlled and operated in a transparent and legitimate way, so that
the riches of the Democratic Republic of the Congo can benefit the Congolese
people;
8. Stresses the importance of following up the independent findings of the
Panel regarding the link between the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the continuation of the conflict, stresses
the importance of exerting the necessary pressure to put an end to such exploitation,
notes that the reports of the Panel to date have made a useful contribution to the
peace process in this regard, and therefore requests the Secretary-General to give a
new mandate to the Panel for a period of six months at the end of which the Panel
should provide a report to the Council;
9. Stresses that the new mandate of the Panel should include:
– Further review of relevant data and analysis of information previously
gathered by the Panel, as well as any new information, including specifically
material provided by individuals and entities named in the previous reports of
the Panel, in order to verify, reinforce and, where necessary, update the Panel’s
findings, and/or clear parties named in the Panel’s previous reports, with a
view to adjusting accordingly the lists attached to these reports;
– Information on actions taken by Governments in response to the Panel’s
previous recommendations, including information on how capacity-building

of paragraphs 12 and 15 below;
– Recommendations on measures a transitional Government in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and other Governments in the region could take to

people;

15 October 2002, as an attachment to this report, no later than 15 April 2003;

companies and States and requests in this regard that the Panel provide to the
individuals, companies and States named, upon request, all information and
documentation connecting them to the illegal exploitation of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo’s natural resources, and requests the Panel to establish a
procedure to provide to Member States, upon request, information previously
collected by the Panel to help them take the necessary investigative action, subject
to the Panel’s duty to preserve the safety of its sources, and in accordance with
United Nations established practice in consultation with the United Nations Office
of Legal Affairs;

OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises in the States where business

the OECD guidelines are registered, in accordance with United Nations established
practice;
15. Urges all States, especially those in the region to conduct their own
investigations, including as appropriate through judicial means, in order to clarify
credibly the findings of the Panel, taking into account the fact that the Panel, which
is not a judicial body, does not have the resources to carry out an investigation
whereby these findings can be considered as established facts;
16. In this regard, notes with satisfaction the decision of the Attorney
General of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to start a judicial procedure,
commends the decision of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
to suspend momentarily the officials named in the reports pending further
4
S/RES/1457 (2003)
clarification, and requests the Panel to cooperate fully with the Office of the
Attorney General and to provide to this Office information it may need to conduct
its investigations, subject to the Panel’s duty to preserve the safety of its sources,
and in accordance with United Nations established practice in consultation with the
United Nations Office of Legal Affairs;
17. Further notes with satisfaction the actions taken by other States,
including the decision by the Government of Uganda to establish a Judicial
Commission of Inquiry, urges all States concerned and in particular the
Governments of Zimbabwe and Rwanda to cooperate fully with the Panel and
investigate further the accusations made through due judicial process and stresses
the importance of collaboration between the Panel and all investigative bodies;
18. Encourages all organizations concerned to consider, as appropriate, the
relevant recommendations contained in the reports of the Panel, and in particular

plundering of the natural resources in these areas;

relevant States must extend their full cooperation to the Panel, while ensuring
