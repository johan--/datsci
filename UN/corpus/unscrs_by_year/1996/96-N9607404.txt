RESOLUTION 1051 (1996)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 3644th meeting,
on 27 March 1996
The Security Council,
Reaffirming its resolution 687 (1991) of 8 April 1991, and in particular
section C thereof, its resolution 707 (1991) of 15 August 1991 and its
resolution 715 (1991) of 11 October 1991 and the plans for ongoing monitoring
and verification approved thereunder,
Recalling the request in paragraph 7 of its resolution 715 (1991) to the
Committee established under resolution 661 (1990), the Special Commission and
the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to develop
in cooperation a mechanism for monitoring any future sales or supplies by other
countries to Iraq of items relevant to the implementation of section C of
resolution 687 (1991) and other relevant resolutions, including resolution
715 (1991) and the plans approved thereunder,
Having considered the letter of 7 December 1995 (S/1995/1017) to the
President of the Council from the Chairman of the Committee established under
resolution 661 (1990), annex I of which contains the provisions for the
mechanism for export/import monitoring called for in paragraph 7 of resolution
715 (1991),
Recognizing that the export/import monitoring mechanism is an integral part
of ongoing monitoring and verification by the Special Commission and the IAEA,
Recognizing that the export/import mechanism is not a regime for
international licensing, but rather for the timely provision of information by
States in which companies are located which are contemplating sales or supplies
to Iraq of items covered by the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification
and will not impede Iraqâ€™s legitimate right to import or export for
non-proscribed purposes, items and technology necessary for the promotion of its
economic and social development,
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
96-07404 (E) /...
