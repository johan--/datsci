on 8 May 1996
The Security Council,
Reaffirming its resolution 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991 and all subsequent
relevant resolutions,
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General dated 30 April 1996
(S/1996/328),
Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the unity and territorial integrity
of Angola,
Reiterating the importance it attaches to the full and timely
implementation by the Government of Angola and Uni√£o Nacional para a
Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA) of the "Acordos de Paz" (S/22609, annex),
the Lusaka Protocol (S/1994/1441, annex) and relevant Security Council
resolutions,
Recognizing that although some progress has been made towards consolidating
the peace process, the overall pace has been disappointingly slow,
Noting with concern the repeated delays in the implementation of successive
timetables agreed to by the two parties, in particular the quartering of UNITA
troops and the completion of talks on military issues regarding the integration
of the armed forces,
Taking note that five months have elapsed since the first UNITA troops
arrived in quartering areas and expressing concern that prolonging the stay of
troops in quartering areas puts strains on United Nations resources and on
discipline within UNITA ranks,
Noting the agreement reached between the President of Angola and the
Chairman of UNITA in Libreville, Gabon, on 1 March 1996 (S/1996/175, annex) on
the formation of the unified armed forces by June 1996 as well as the
