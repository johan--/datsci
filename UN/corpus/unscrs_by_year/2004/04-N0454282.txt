caused by acts of terrorism motivated by intolerance or extremism in various
regions of the world,
Calling upon States to cooperate fully with the Counter-Terrorism Committee
(CTC) established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001), including the recently
established Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), the
“Al-Qaida/Taliban Sanctions Committee” established pursuant to resolution 1267

cooperation, which by itself is necessary to sustain the broadest possible fight
against terrorism,

threats to peace and security;
2. Calls upon States to cooperate fully in the fight against terrorism,
especially with those States where or against whose citizens terrorist acts are
committed, in accordance with their obligations under international law, in order to

or prosecute, any person who supports, facilitates, participates or attempts to
participate in the financing, planning, preparation or commission of terrorist acts or
provides safe havens;
3. Recalls that criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the
intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose
to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or
particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an
international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act, which constitute
offences within the scope of and as defined in the international conventions and
protocols relating to terrorism, are under no circumstances justifiable by

other similar nature, and calls upon all States to prevent such acts and, if not

convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism;

to strengthen international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and to intensify
their interaction with the United Nations and, in particular, the CTC with a view to
facilitating full and timely implementation of resolution 1373 (2001);

practices to assist States in implementing the provisions of resolution 1373 (2001)
related to the financing of terrorism;

cooperation with relevant international, regional and subregional organizations to

provision of technical and other assistance for such implementation;

Security Council to consider and submit recommendations to the Council on
practical measures to be imposed upon individuals, groups or entities involved in or
associated with terrorist activities, other than those designated by the
Al-Qaida/Taliban Sanctions Committee, including more effective procedures
considered to be appropriate for bringing them to justice through prosecution or
extradition, freezing of their financial assets, preventing their movement through the
territories of Member States, preventing supply to them of all types of arms and
related material, and on the procedures for implementing these measures;
10. Requests further the working group, established under paragraph 9 to
consider the possibility of establishing an international fund to compensate victims
of terrorist acts and their families, which might be financed through voluntary

organizations, their members and sponsors, and submit its recommendations to the
Council;
