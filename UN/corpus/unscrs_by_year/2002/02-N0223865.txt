Principles for the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi” and of
its letter of transmittal, with the contribution and the full support of all members of
the Group of Friends, and supports the efforts of the Special Representative on the
basis of these documents which are positive elements for launching the peace
process between the sides;
4. Recalls that the purpose of these documents is to facilitate meaningful
negotiations between the parties, under the leadership of the United Nations, on the
status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia, and is not an attempt to impose or
dictate any specific solution to the parties;
5. Further recalls that the process of negotiation leading to a lasting
political settlement acceptable to both sides will require concessions from both
sides;

without delay thereafter, and calls on others having influence with the parties to
promote this outcome;

two sides on 17 January 2002 regarding the situation in the Kodori Valley, calls for

the withdrawal of Georgian troops, recognizes the legitimate security concerns of
the civilian populations in the area, calls on the political leaders in Tbilisi and

and as set out in the Quadripartite Agreement of 4 April 1994 (S/1994/397, annex

returnees and to facilitate the return of the remaining displaced population, and

responsible for the shooting down of a UNOMIG helicopter on 8 October 2001 and
to bring them to justice, expresses also its concern at the disturbing tendency by the
parties to restrict the freedom of movement of UNOMIG, thereby hindering the
ability of the Mission to fulfil its mandate, including through effective patrolling,
and underlines that it is the primary responsibility of both sides to provide
appropriate security and to ensure the freedom of movement of UNOMIG, the CIS
peacekeeping force and other international personnel;
