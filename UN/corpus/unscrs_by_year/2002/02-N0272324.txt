country, including in the diamond-producing areas, with the assistance of the United

illicit trade in diamonds and its potential negative impact on the fragile situation in
Sierra Leone,
Welcoming General Assembly resolution A/RES/56/263 of 13 March 2002, as
well as ongoing efforts by interested States, the diamond industry, in particular the
World Diamond Council, and non-governmental organizations to break the link

significant progress made by the Kimberley Process, and encouraging further
progress in this regard,
Emphasizing the responsibility of all Member States, including diamond-
importing countries, for fully implementing the measures in resolution 1385 (2001),
