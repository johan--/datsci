President on the situation in Afghanistan,
Recalling resolution 52/211 of the General Assembly,
Expressing its grave concern at the continued Afghan conflict, which has
recently sharply escalated as a result of the offensive by the Taliban forces,

the fighting, and causing a serious and growing threat to regional and
international peace and security, as well as extensive human suffering, further
destruction, refugee flows and other forcible displacement of large numbers of
people,
Deploring the fact that despite the readiness of the United Front of
Afghanistan to conclude a durable ceasefire and to enter into a political
dialogue with the Taliban, fighting continues on both sides,
Concerned also by the increasingly ethnic nature of the conflict, by
reports of ethnic and religious-based persecution, particularly against the
Shiites, and by the threat this poses to the unity of the Afghan State,
Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence,
territorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan, and its respect for its
cultural and historical heritage,
Reiterating that any outside interference in the internal affairs of
Afghanistan, including the involvement of foreign military personnel and the
supply of arms and ammunition to all parties to the conflict, should cease
immediately,
