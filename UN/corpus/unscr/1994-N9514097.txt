necessity for those courts to deal with large numbers of suspects,

resolution 935 (1994) should continue on an urgent basis the collection of

humanitarian law committed in the territory of Rwanda and should submit its
final report to the Secretary-General by 30 November 1994,

the United Nations and the State of the seat, acceptable to the Council, having
regard to the fact that the International Tribunal may meet away from its seat
when it considers it necessary for the efficient exercise of its functions; and
