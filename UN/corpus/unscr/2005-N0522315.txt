Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 17 January 2005,
Recalling the conclusions of the Lisbon (S/1997/57, annex) and Istanbul

regarding the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia,
Recalling the relevant principles contained in the Convention on the Safety of

Deploring that the perpetrators of the shooting down of a helicopter of the

resulted in the death of nine people on board, have still not been identified,
Stressing that the continued lack of progress on key issues of a comprehensive

Welcoming, however, the positive momentum given to the United Nations-led
peace process by regular high level meetings of the Group of Friends in Geneva and
the Georgian-Russian summit meetings,
Welcoming the important contributions made by UNOMIG and the Collective
Peacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS
peacekeeping force) in stabilizing the situation in the zone of conflict, and stressing
its attachment to the close cooperation existing between them in the performance of
their respective mandates,

independence and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally
recognized borders, and the necessity to define the status of Abkhazia within the
State of Georgia in strict accordance with these principles;
2. Commends and strongly supports the sustained efforts of the Secretary-
General and his Special Representative, with the assistance of the Russian
Federation in its capacity as facilitator as well as of the Group of Friends of the
2
S/RES/1582 (2005)
Secretary-General and of the OSCE, to promote the stabilization of the situation and
the achievement of a comprehensive political settlement, which must include a
settlement of the political status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia;

discussion on the substance of this document, again strongly urges the Abkhaz side
to receive the document and its transmittal letter, urges both parties thereafter to
give them full and open consideration, and to engage in constructive negotiations on
their substance, and urges those having influence with the parties to promote this
outcome;
5. Regrets also the lack of progress on the initiation of political status
negotiations, and recalls, once again, that the purpose of these documents is to

mutual mistrust and underlines that the process of negotiation leading to a lasting

working groups established in Sochi in March 2003, and reiterates that results-
oriented activities in these three priority areas remain key to building common
ground between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides and ultimately for concluding
meaningful negotiations on a comprehensive political settlement based on the paper
entitled “Basic Principles for the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and
Sukhumi” and its transmittal letter;
12. Encourages the sides in that respect to continue their discussion on
security guarantees with the participation of the Group of Friends;

S/RES/1582 (2005)
13. Calls again on the parties to take concrete steps to revitalize the peace
process in all its major aspects, including their work in the Coordinating Council
and its relevant mechanisms, to build on the results of the Yalta meeting on
confidence-building measures in March 2001 (S/2001/242) and to implement the

20. Urges the parties once again to implement the recommendations of the
Joint Assessment Mission to the Gali sector (November 2000), regrets that there has
been no progress to that effect despite the positive consideration by the parties given
to those recommendations in the first Geneva meeting and calls again upon the
Abkhaz side to agree to the opening as soon as possible of the Gali branch of the
human rights office in Sukhumi and to provide security conditions for its
unhindered functioning;
21. Reiterates its concern that despite the start of the deployment of a
civilian police component as part of UNOMIG, as endorsed in resolution 1494

involving the local population and to address the lack of instruction in their mother

in the upper Kodori valley by joint UNOMIG and CIS peacekeeping force patrols;
