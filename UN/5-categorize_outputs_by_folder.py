''' A clean version of the script to 1) explore the text of UN Security Council 
resolutions (SCRs) (outputs), 2) find files of interest, 3) determine how to categorize them, and 
4) rename the files by category in order to 5) create a categorized corpus.
In the corpus, the filenames follow the format of YYYY-NDOCNUMB.txt, 
e.g. 1994-N1234567.txt

Clean files in unscrs_clean.zip
Renamed files in unscrs_renamed.zip
Categorized files in unscrs_renamed_categorized.zip

import glob

# 1. Explore text: 
# Here I define a function to explore the text of the documents to validate my logic.
# This is a quick way to understand in what collocations phrases are typically used
# and what kinds of topics they tend to reference. 

# Files contained in unscrs_clean.zip

def explore(strings):
    for filename in glob.glob('*.txt'):
        for line in open(filename):
            if strings in line:
                print line
                print filename # becomes very useful later to see which kinds of files the text is found in
    

# For example, actions the SC authorizes:
explore("authorizes")
# Phrases used in relation to arms embargoes:
explore("States shall prevent")
# Phrases used in relation to economic sanctions:
explore("economic activities")

''' The format of most SCRs is as follows: the first part outlines general positions
of the Council on certain things, using verbs in gerund form ("welcoming", "noting"),
while the second part states decisions taken, with verbs in the present tense ("decides",
"urges"). Most substantive actions are described in the first 1-3 points of the second part;
typically, if a resolution authorizes the deployment or extension of a mission or some
other kind of UN delegation/body, this will be stated first. 
'''
# Here I validate the logic described above.
explore("Decides")
# Here I make an educated guess that anytime "under Chapter VII" is used, it will
# always be in the context of "acting under Chapter VII (...)" and always in reference
# to a mission authorized to use force in situations of crisis.
explore("under Chapter VII")

# Further text exploration
explore("use all necessary means") # authorizing military personnel to shoot in defense of civilians
explore("drawdown") # drawing down missions
explore("Decides to extend") # extending a mission's mandate
explore("prevent the entry into or transit through their territories") # enacting travel bans 

# 2. Find files of interest based on text data, append their filenames to a list.
# Note: I can't create an empty list within the function, otherwise an existing list
# to which I would like to append other filenames based on other phrases found within
# will be overwritten every time.
def find_files(lists, expressions):
    for filename in glob.glob('*.txt'):
        for line in open(filename):
            if expressions in line:
                print filename # included for reference, to give an idea of how many there are and from what years
                lists.append(filename)
    print lists
    
# 3. Determine how to categorize files:
# Thinking also about how to structure the code that will distribute these files
# by category or "bin" within the directory in order to later build the categorized
# corpus.
    
# Thematic organization
# Soft measures
police = "police_" # civilian police component
embargo = "emb_" # embargoes
adv_team = "adv_team_" # advance teams
observers = "mil_observ_" # military observers
ban = "transit_ban_" # transit ban - sanctions
experts = "experts_" # establishment of panels of experts
fund = "fund_" # establishment of trust fund for operations
office = "office_"

# Chapter VII mission
chapter7 = "ch7_" # deployment of missions with military personnel under Chapter VII

# Mission extension
extend = "extend_" # extending mission mandates

# Drawdown, reversal of measures
drawdown = "drawdown_" # mission drawdown, termination of previously imposed measures
suspend = "suspend_" # suspend prohibitions

# Everything else will be read as "no action taken". Currently this seems to be
# about 280 documents out of the corpus (~1,250 total).

# 4. Rename the files by category, based on whether their filenames are in a given topical list:
def rename_files(list_name, var_name):
    for filename in os.listdir("."):
        if filename in list_name:
            os.rename(filename, var_name+filename)
            print filename # same as above, included for reference

'''
Next steps:
1. Using previously assembled CSV file, match resolutions by number to category: 
- create a new "category" column 
- read resolution files using glob
- each file will contain the resolution number
- if the file is in the folder "soft_action", write "0" to the corresponding cell in the "category" column
- if the file is in the folder "intervention", write "1" 
- for all others, write "NaN" and drop with pandas
2. Read the text of each input (meeting record) into the corresponding cell in a new dataframe column
3. Select model(s), train & test
