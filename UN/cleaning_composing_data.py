'''
The purpose of this code was to determine why I had 1236 meeting records in my working CSV file
and only 1229 files in my meeting records corpus.
There is likely a way to refactor this more elegantly; however, going back and forth
from pandas objects to lists was fairly easy.
I also discovered some errors in the way new, clean(er) copies of the CSV file were written;
a lot of these issues turned out to be much easier to find and remedy by hand in Excel.

# found six files that were definitively missing from records
# these files were downloaded, converted and added to the corpus
# also established that the CSV file has two entries with identical meeting record numbers
# that generated two distinct resolutions, which is where the discrepancy lies.
# To resolve this difference, I copied the file with the meeting record under the duplicate number and
# assigned it a different number. This shouldn't affect the model because 
# the same meeting led to two different resolutions.
# Confirmed that no other data is missing.
