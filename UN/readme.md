# Tower of Babble? Predicting (in)action by the UN Security Council

This repository contains all relevant code and data for my final project for General Assembly's Data Science 7 class in Washington, DC, submitted in August 2015. The [/corpus](../corpus) directory contains all input and outcome files in .txt format. The Python code files and iPython notebooks in the root directory contain all code used to build the complete dataset, build predictive models and visualize data outputs. 

The final paper for this project can be found on the [project page](http://wandergram.github.io/tower).
